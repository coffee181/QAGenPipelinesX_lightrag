1.2  CNC System of Machine Tools and CNC Machine Tools 
CNC machine tool is an electro-mechanical integrated product, composed of Numerical Control 
Systems of Machine Tools, machines, electric control components, hydraulic components, pneumatic 
components, lubricating, cooling and other subsystems (components), and CNC systems of machine 
tools are control cores of CNC machine tools. CNC systems of machine tools are made up of 
computerized numerical control(CNC), servo (stepper) motor drive devices, servo (or stepper) motor 
etc.  
Operational principles of CNC machine tools: according to requirements of machining 
technology, edit user programs and input them to CNC, then CNC outputs motion control codes to the 
servo (stepper) motor drive devices, and last the servo (or stepper) motor completes the cutting feed 
of machine tool by mechanical driving device; logic control codes in user programs to control spindle 
start/stop, tool selections, cooling ON/OFF, lubricant ON/OFF are output to electric control systems of 
machine tools from CNC, and then the electric control systems control output components including 
buttons, switches, indicators, relays, contactors and so on. Presently, the electric control systems are 
employed with Programmable Logic Controller (PLC) with characteristics of compact, convenience 
and high reliance. Thereof, the motion control systems and logic control systems are the main of CNC 
machine tools.  
The system has simultaneously motion control and logic control function to control two axes of 
CNC machine tool to move, and has PLC function. Edit PLC programs (ladder diagram) according to 
requirements of input and output control of machine tool and then download them to 
GSK988MA/988MB Milling Machine CNC system, which realizes the required electric control 
requirements of machine tool, is convenient to electric design of machine tool and reduces cost of 
CNC machine tool.  
Softwares realizing CNC control function is divided into system software (NC for short) and PLC 
software (PLC for short). NC system is used for controlling display, communication, edit, decoding, 
interpolation and acceleration/deceleration, and PLC system for controlling explanations, executions, 
inputs and outputs of ladder diagrams. 
Standard PLC programs are loaded when the system is delivered, concerned PLC control 
functions in following functions and operations are described according to control logics of standard 
PLC programs, marking with “Standard PLC functions” in GSK988MA/988MB Milling CNC System 
User Manual. Refer to Operation Manual of machine manufacturer about functions and operations of 
PLC control because the machine manufacturer may modify or edit PLC programs again. 
Programming is a course of workpiece contours, machining technologies, technology 
parameters and tool parameters being edit into part programs according to special CNC 
programming G codes. CNC machining is a course of CNC controlling a machine tool to complete 
machining of workpiece according requirements of part programs. Technical flow of CNC machining 
is shown in Fig. 1-2-1.

1.3.2  Increment System 
Increment system includes least input increment (input) and least code increment (output). Least 
input increment is the least unit of programming movement distance. Least code increment is the 
least unit of tool movement on the machine tool. Their unit: mm, inch or degree.  
Increment systems are separately IS-B and IS-C. No.1004 Bit1 decides to select IS-B or IS-C.

1.3.4  Reference Point 
A reference point is a fixed point on the machine tool. The tool can move to the position by 
executing the reference point return function. Generally, the reference point is used to tool change 
and setting coordinate system. GSK988MA/MB Milling CNC System can set 4 reference positions by 
parameters, which is shown in the following figure： 
Y
X
 
Fig.1-3-1 reference point 
1.3.5  Machine Coordinate System 
The machine tool coordinate system is a benchmark one used for the CNC counting coordinates 
and a fixed one on the machine tool. A machine tool zero is a fixed point which position is specified by 
zero switch or zero return switch on the machine tool. After the system is turned on, the reference 
point return is executed to set machine coordinate system. The machine coordinate system is not 
keeping until the system is turned off.  
Note: For the machine with the incremental encoder, must execute the reference position return every time to set 
the machine coordinate system after power-off; for the machine with the multi-coil absolute encoder, need 
not execute the reference position return every time after power-off. 
1.3.6  Workpice Coordinate System 
The workpiece coordinate system is a rectangular coordinate system based on the part drawing, 
also called floating coordinate system. The workpiece coordinate system is set by the system in 
advance, can be changed by moving its coordinate origin point. The established workpiece is valid till 
it is replaced by a new one. The system has preset 6 workpice coordinate systems (G54-G59). 
1.3.7  Local Coordinate System 
When the system compiling programs in the workpiece coordinate system, sub-coordinate 
system of workpiece coordinate system can be set for easily programming, called local coordinate 
system as follows:

1.3.8  Interpolation Function 
Interpolation is defined as a planar or three dimensional contour formed by path of 2 or multiple 
axes moving at the same time, also called Contour control. The controlled moving axis is called link 
axis when the interpolation is executed. The moving distance, direction and speed of it are controlled 
synchronously in the course of running to form the required Composite motion path. Positioning 
control is defined that a motion end point of one axis or multiple axes instead of the motion path in the 
course of running is controlled.  
Linear interpolation: Composite motion path of Xp、Yp and Zp axis is a straight line from start 
point to end point. 
Circular interpolation: Composite motion path of Xp/Yp、Yp/Zp and Zp/Xp axis is arc radius 
defined by R or the circle center (I, J, K) from start point to end point.  
Thread interpolation：Xp、Yp、Zp three axis linkage which at the same time, the current plane axis 
arc interpolation, perpendicular to the plane of the shaft in a certain 
proportion of linear interpolation. 
Note 1:Xp, Yp, Zp are separately X or its parallel axis, Y or its parallel axis, Z or its parallel axis. The 
followings are the same as those.  
Note 2: IP expresses the combination of X_Y_Z_(used in programming). 
1.4  Coordinate Value and Dimension 
1.4.1  Absolute Programming and Incremental Programming 
There are two kinds of modes for commanding axis offset, one is absolute command the other is 
incremental command. The absolute command is programmed by coordinate value of the terminal 
position by the axis movement. The incremental command is directly programmed by the movement 
value of the axis. They are separately specified by G90 and G91 commands. 
Code format：G90  IP  ；  Absolute command 
 
 
      G91  IP  ；  Incremental command 
1.4.2  Decimal Programming 
Value can be input by decimal programming. Distance, time and speed can be input by decimal 
programming. The following addresses can use decimal point: X, Y, Z, A, B, C, U, V, W, H, I, J, K, R 
and F, and other addresses cannot use decimal programming. An alarm occurs a word has more 
than one decimal point; an alarm occurs when an address which cannot be specified by a decimal 
point has a decimal point.  
There are two types of decimal point usage which is decided by No. 3401 Bit0(DPI).  
When NO.3401 Bit0(DPI) is set to 1, a value without a decimal point is with mm, inch. 
When NO.3401 Bit0(DPI) is set to 0, an input value is specified by least input increment.

The decimal which is less than the least input increment unit is discarded in course of program 
being executed.  
Example: X2.34567. When the least unit of input increment is 0.001mm, X2.34567 becomes 
X2.345, when the least unit is 0.0001inch, it becomes X2.3456. 
1.4.3  Conversion between the Metric and the Inch 
Metric input or inch input is set by NO.0000 Bit2(INI). G codes corresponding to metric/inch 
system is as follows:   
G20： inch input ； 
G21： mm input. 
Input data unit becomes the inch or metric input unit when NO.0000 Bit2 (INI) setting is changed. 
But, the angle unit is not changed. It is suggested that the system should be turned on again when INI 
is modified. The unit of the following value is changed after metric/inch system is switched.  
——F feedrate;  
——position code;  
——zero offset of workpiece; 
——tool compensation value;  
——graduation unit of MPG;  
——movement distance in incremental feed. 
 
NO.1001 Bit0 (INM) can be used to set machine’s metric/inch output instead of metric/inch input. 
 
1.4.4  Linear Axis and Rotary Axis 
NO.1006 Bit0 (ROTx) can set each axis to a linear axis or rotary axis. NO. 1006 Bit 1 (ROSx) can 
be used to select the rotary type for each axis.  
Absolute coordinate value is displayed circularly with the movement per rev set by NO.1260 
when the cycle function is executed, which can prevent the rotary axis from overflowing. The cycle 
function is valid when NO.1008 Bit 0(ROAx) is set to 1.   
For absolute value code, the coordinate value is the corresponding angle cycle value of per rev 
set by NO. 1260 after the machine moves. When NO.1008 Bit 1(RABx) is set to 0, the machine 
rotates according to the shortest distance (to the target point). For incremental code, the machine 
moves according to the angle defined by the code. 
 
1.5  Structure of an NC Program 
A program consists of a sequence of blocks, beginning with “OXXXX”(program name)and ending with  
“M30”. A block consist of many words, beginning with block number (can be omitted) and ending with  
“；”.

1.5.1  Program Name 
Format：O △△△△ 
 
Program number (0000～9999, the leading zero can be omitted） 
Address O 
△△△△ is number of a program name, its range is 4-digit integer 0000～9999, an alarm occurs when 
the negative program name is input. 
 
1.5.2  Block Format 
   1. Format: /  N△△△△△countless words;       
      /：          skip character. A block can have or not it, generally, it is placed in the initial 
position of a program; user can press “SKIP” on the operation panel to 
execute the operation when the skip function is valid, otherwise, the 
“SKIP” key on the operation panel is valid, i.e. the skip character in the 
block is invalid;  
N△△△△△：block number. A block can have or not it; number △△△△△ following N is 
5-digit non-negative integer 00001～99999, and the system alarms when 
the input number is decimal.  
 
Countless words: one block can input countless words, and one block can have one or more 
words or have no words.  
；：           “EOB” is a end character when one block is completed, “;” is displayed in LCD, 
there must be have one end character for one block; 
2. Format requirements 
（1）In one block, there can be no blank space between block number and word, and can be 
countless blank space(the total characters of one block is within 255); 
（2）In one block, there can be not or be countless space between skip character and block  
number or words;  
（3）In one block, there can be not or be countless space between end character of block and its 
front word or blocks;  
Each block can be up to 256 characters, including skip character, block number, code, 
space, end character of block“;”;  
（4）The system automatically ignores the content with small bracket “(”,“)”. 
 
Explanations of program annotation:  
Note: The annotation of program home as the total annotation of a program is displayed in the 
program catalog window, the created program automatically creates the small brackets“(”、“)”, 
if they are deleted, the system has no them and they can be replaced by “;”. 
Sprit(/) explanations: 
Slash sign (/) explanations:  
Note 1：When the slash sign (/) is taken as a skip sign, it is placed at the beginning of a block. 
When it is placed at other places and the skip switch is open, the messages between the 
slant and EOB code are ignored. Example: U10. G00/04；when the skip switch is open, 
the system executes U10. G00;(G00 U10.); when the skip switch is closed, it executes 


Chapter 1  Programming Fundamental 
13 
I  Programming 
U10. G0004;(G04 U10.); 
Note 2：When the cycle code buffer is executed and the block is read to the buffer memory from 
the memory, the system ensures the skip function is valid. After the block is read into the 
buffer memory, even if the skip switch state is changed, the block read into the buffer is 
not influenced;   
Note 3：The slash (/) symbol in <Expression> (closed in the brackets[]) and that at the right of 
assignment statement “=” are taken as a division operator, which is not taken as a skip 
symbol.  
 
3. Parameters relevant with a block number:  
（1）Automatically creates a block number： 
         The user can set the system automatically creates a block number by No.0000 bit5(SEQ);  
（2）The user can set a interval value by No.3216 when the system automatically creates bock 
numbers. 
1.5.3  Word 
1. Format: address + number. There must not be a space between address and number.  
Presently, the system permissively input addresses: G, M, S, T, F, X, Y, Z, U, V, W, P, Q, I, J, K, 
R, L, A, B, C, H, N, O，and will add other.

 When these word addresses follow data (with positive/negative sign), data precision is least 
code increment, and excessive data is ignored. When a word address follows variable number or has 
[ ] expression, the word value has decimal data, and its precision is the least code increment, but its 
excessive data rounds.  
（4）No.3401#0  DPI 
DPI    can use decimal address. When the decimal is omitted, its setting is as follows: 
0：least  setting unit  
1：unit: mm，inch，s 
When parameter DPI is set to 1, word range is referred to Table 1-5-2;  
When DPI is set to 0, and word omits its decimal, its value range is -99999999～99999999, data 
unit is the least code increment in Table 1-5-2. 
 
*2）：Code value calculation method specified by U, W, R, K is the same that of  *1）, they meet the 
value range described in  *1） and limit value range according to preparatory function.

（1）Can or not input a block number in one block (must input block number in target block in 
which program skips), when many block number are input in one block, only the last block 
number is valid;  
（2）A block number can be placed any position of block but it is suggested that it should be 
placed at the initial position in order to search and read；  
（3）There can be many same block number in one program, but the block number of target 
block of program skip has only one; otherwise, the program skips to the nearest block to the 
block;  
（4）Block numbers can be placed at will.(it is suggested that it should be placed by the rising or 
falling monotonously;  
Note: When the block number exceeds the range, and the program runs or the grammatical check is 
done, the relevant alarm occurs.  
1.5.5  Mainprogram and Subprogram 
To simplify the programming, when machining path, the same or similar control process need to 
be used many times, can take the part of the code editor for the independent procedure call. Call the 
program called the mainprogram, the called program (end with M99) called a subprogram. 


Chapter 1  Programming Fundamental

I  Programming 
Subprogram and mainprogram as the occupation of the system program capacity and storage space, 
the subprogram must have its own independent subprogram name, can be any of the other 
mainprogram call, you can also run independently. Subprogram after return to the mainprogram 
execution continues. 
 
Fig.1-5-2 
1.6  Program Run 
1.6.1  Sequence of Program Run 
Running the current open program must be in Auto mode. GSK988MA cannot open two or more 
programs at the same time, and runs only one program any time. When one program is open, the 
cursor is located at display line of the program name and can be moved in Edit mode. In the run stop 
state in Auto mode, the program starts to run by the cycle start signal (CYCLE START key) is pressed 
or external cycle start signal)from a block pointed by current cursor, usually blocks are executed one 
by one according to their programming sequence, the program stops running till executing M02 or 
M30. The cursor moves along with program running and is located at the heading of the current block. 
Sequence and state of program running are changed in the followings:  
◆The program stops run after pressing RESET or EMERGENCY STOP button; 
◆The program stops running when the CNC system or PLC alarms; 
◆The program runs and single block stops (the program run stops after the current block 
runs completely) in Edit, MDI mode, and then a block pointed by the current cursor starts 
running after the system switches into Auto mode, the CYCLE START key is pressed or 
external cycle start signal is switched on;  
◆The program stops run in Manual(Jog), Handwheel (MPG), Single Block, Program 
Reference position Return, Machine Reference position Return mode and it continuously 
runs from the current stop position after the system is switched into Auto mode and the 
CYCLE START key is pressed or the external cycle start signal is switched on;  
◆The program pauses after pressing the FEED HOLD key or the external cycle start signal 
is switched off, and it continuously runs from current position after pressing the CYCLE 
START key or the external cycle start signal is switched on;  
◆When Single Block is ON, the program pauses after every block is executed completely, 
and then it continuously runs from the next block after the CYCLE START key is pressed 
or the external cycle start signal is switched on; 
◆Block with “/” in the front of it is not executed when the block skipping switch is ON;  
◆Call corresponding subprograms or macro program to run when executing M98; the

system returns to main program to call the next block when executing M99(if M99 
specifies a target block number, the system returns to it to run) after the subprograms or 
macro programs run completely;  
◆The system returns to the first block to run and the current program is executed repetitively 
when M99 is executed in a main program. 
1.6.2  Execution Sequence of Word 
There are many words (G, X, Z, F, R, M, S, T and so on) and most of M, S, T are transmitted to 
PLC by NC explaining and others are directly executed by NC. M98, M99, S word for specifying 
spindle speed (r/min, m/min) is directly executed by NC.  
The NC firstly executes G and then M codes when G codes and M00, M01, M02 and M30 are in 
the same block.  
The NC firstly executes G and then M codes( without transmitting M signal to PLC) when G 
codes and M98, M99 are in the same block.  
When G codes and M, S, T executed by PLC are in the same block, PLC defines M, S, T and G 
to be executed simultaneously, or execute M, S ,T after G codes. Pleaste see User Manual of 
machine manufacturer for execution sequence of codes.  
Execution sequence of G, M (except for the above M codes), S, T defined by GSK988MA/MB PLC in 
the same block is determined by PLC, which is divided into two methods:  
            a) Movement codes and M miscellaneous code are executed simultaneously.  
             b) Execute miscellaneous codes after executing movement codes.  
Refer to the machine manufacture’s user manual for the concrete execution method. 
The second method is executed when there is M9, M99, M13, M33 or M5 for our GSK ladder.  
 
Note: When G28 or G30 and M01 are in the same block, the pause after zero return is done. When there is 
a single block stop code without M01, the single block stop is executed at the middle point and zero 
return completion position.

Chapter 2  G Codes 
2.1  Summary 
G code consists of code address G and its following code value, used for defining the motion 
mode of tool relative to the workpiece, defining the coordinates and so on. Refer to G codes as Fig. 
2-1-1. 
      
 
The G command words can be classified into 16 groups such as 00, 01, 02, 03, 05, 06, 07, 08, 09, 
10 ,12，14，16，17 and 22. They share the same block except for 01 and 00 groups, different groups 
G commands can be defined at the same block. The last G command is valid when two or more same 
group G commands are introduced at the same block. Different G command groups without common 
parameter (command word) can be defined at the same block, and their functions are simultaneously 
valid regardless of sequence. If the G command or the optional G command other than Table 3-1 is 
employed, alarm occurs.

2.1.1  Modal, Non-modal and Initial State 
The G commands can be set to 16 groups such as 00, 01, 02, 03, 05, 06, 07, 08, 09, 
10 ,11,12 ,13,14,15,16and 22. Thereinto, G commands of 00 group are non-modal G commands, 
that of other G group are modal commands. G00, G80, G40, G49 ,G67 and G94 are initial G 
commands. 
After the G command is executed,  the function defined or status is valid until it is changed  by 
other G command where in the same group, this kind of command is called modal G command. 
After this G command is performed and before the function defined or status is changed, this G 
command need not be input again when the next block performs this G command. 
After the G command is performed, the function defined or status is valid for once, The G  
command word should be input again while every time the G command is performed, this kind of 
command is called non-modal G command. 
The modal G command is valid without performing its function or state after the system is 
powered on, this is called initial G command. If the G command is not introduced after the power is 
turned on, then the initial G command is executed. The initial commands of GSK988MA are G00, G17, 
G40,G49, G54, G67, G80, G90, G97, and G98.

Note 1: I0, J0 and K0 can be omitted; but, it is very necessary to input one of the addresses I, J, K or R, or the system 
alarm is generated. 
Note 2: The X, Y and Z can be omitted simultaneously when the end and start points share same position. When the 
center point is specified by address I, J and K, it is a 360° arc.

It is recommended that programming uses R.  In  order  to  guarantee  the  start  and  
end  points  of  the  arc  are consistent with the specified value, the system will move by 
counting R again according to the selected plane, when programming using the I, J and K. After

2.6  Cylindrical Interpolation G07.1 
Function：In the cylindrical interpolation, the travel amount of rotary axis specified by an angle is 
converted to a distance of a linear axis on the outer surface in CNC, so that linear 
interpolation or circular interpolation can be performed with another axis. After 
interpolation, convert this distance to the travel amount of the rotary axis. 
 
Fig. 2-7-1 
Because the side of a cylinder is allowed to use in programming, programs for cylindrical 
cam grooving can be created very easily,the following figure 2-7-2。

interpolation starts, r=0 interpolation stops  
G07.1is G code of 00. G107 can be used instead of G07.1. 
Explanations for plane selection: Plane selection is needed in circular interpolation, tool nose radius 
compensation and automatic chamfer. The following table shows the planes of G code selection.

Specify rotary axis as a parallel axis of X, Y, Z by parameter No.1022. Specify G code selection 
plane, and now the rotary axis is regarded as a specified linear axis for the plane. For example, when 
rotary axis is parallel to the axis of X, XP-Y plane should be specified by G17. This plane is 
determined by rotary axis and Y axis. 
For cylindrical interpolation, only a rotary axis can be set. Parallel axes for different planes are 
listed as follows. 
 
Fig.2-7-3 
Note: The above are the plane of “X” displaying, which can not be specified. If it is specified, P/S alarm occurs. 
 
Related explanations for circular interpolation: 
In cylindrical interpolation mode, circular interpolation is possible with the rotary axis and another 
linear axis. The unit for rotary axis is not degrees but millimeters (for metric input) or inches (for inch 
input). 
 
Circular interpolation between the Z axis and C axis 
When the C axis of parameter No.1022. is set to 5 (parallel axis of X axis), in this case, the 
command for circular interpolation is: 
 
G18 Z_ C_;  →  G18 Z_ XP_;  （XP is the parallel axis for X axis） 
G02/G03 Z_ C_ R_;   →  G02/G03 Z_ XP_ R_; 
When the C axis of parameter No.1022. is set to 6 (parallel axis of Y axis), in this case, the 
command for circular interpolation is: 
G19 C_ Z_; →  G19 YP_ Z_;  （YP is the parallel axis for Y axis） 
G02/G03 Z_ C_ R_;   →  G02/G03 Z_ YP_ R_; 
Circular interpolation between the X axis (or Y axis) and C axis is similar to the above. 
Feedrate: The specified federate F (mm/min) in the cylindrical interpolation is the speed of the 
unfolded cylinder surface, which is called linear speed. The linear interpolation and circular 
interpolation is performed with speed F (mm/min).

                      Zp: Z or its parallel axis 
Note 1: Xp, Yp, Zp are determined by the axis addresses of G17, G18, G19 in the block; when the axis 
addresses are omitted, the system defaults the omitted are the addresses of the basic axis; the plane 
keeps when the system does not code G17, G18, G19 blocks.  
Note 2: The parameter (No. 1022) sets each axis to have three basic axes (X, Y, Z) or the parallel axis.  
Note 3: The plane remains unchanged in the G17, G18, G19 not be specified.   
Note 4: When the system is turned on, its initialization is defaulted to G17 state, i.e. XY plane； 
Note 5: When the system repetitively specifies G17～G19 in the same block, and No.3403 Bit 6(AD2) is 0, the 
last G17～G19 word is valid, the system alarms when the parameter is set to 1； 
Note 6:The motion command is not related to the plane selection, besides the arc interpolation and tool nose 
radius compensation command, when the system commands the axis beyond the planes, it does not alarm and 
the axis can move; when the system selects the axis motion beyond the plane in the arc interpolation command, 
For example: 
……； 
G17； 
G01 X100 Y50 Z20 F100；the system does not alarm and the Z axis can move

Explanation：G17,  G18  and  G19  are  modal  G  commands,  the  plane  will  not  be  
changed  when  a  block without any command inside. 
Note 1: The plane selection command can share the same block with other group G commands.  
Note 2: The move command is regardless of the plane selection. For example, the Z axis is not On XY plane, the Z 
axis movement is regardless of the XY plane in command  G17 Z_ .

Note 1: The modal G22/G23 in group 9 can be set by No. 3402 Bit 7(G23); 
Note 2: G22 stored travel check is limited to the stored travel limit check 2, and the detailed is referred to 
OPERATION; 
Note 3: The data is set by the distance (least code increment is taken as the unit) to the reference position when the 
parameter sets the top point of the forbidden area; 
Note 4: Whether the limit range is the inner side or outer side of the area is set by No. 1300 Bit0 (OUT) , and it is the 
inner side when it is set to 0; 
Note 5: The limit is valid after the system executes the reference position return; the system alarms when the 
reference position is in the limit area in G22 mode;  
Note 6: The tool reversely traverses when the travel alarm occurs, and the alarm is cleared after reset again;  
Note 7: G22/G23 is codeed in an alone block, and an alarm occurs when it and other G codes or MST are in the same 
block; 
Note 8: When the system is switched from G23 to G22 in the forbidden area, an alarm occurs;   
Note 9: When No.1310 Bit 0(OT2x) of the stored travel limit check 2 is set to 1(executing the stored travel limit 2 
check), the system executes G22 and then the check; the system does not execute the check when it is G23.

Function：travese to the middle point at rapid traverse speed from start point of the current program 
and then return to the reference point. 
Format：G27  IP__  ； 
Explanation：G27 is a non-modal G command； 
 
note 1：the tool rapidly traverses to the specified position by specifying G27. When the tool 
reaches the reference point, and the reference point return is completed and the indicator is ON. 
note 2： only one axis returning to the reference point means the indicator for the axis having 
completed the reference point return is ON.  
note 3：after the positioning ends, when the specified axis does not reach the reference point, 
No.540 alarm occurs, prompting "G27 reference point return check is mistaken. 
note 4：check whether the current position  is the reference point without an axis moving.  
note 5：the axis for G27 reference point return check must firstly create a reference point, 
otherwise, No.539 alarm occurs "not create a reference point before specifying G27 reference 
point"  
note 6：in machine locked state, executing G27 performs the point positioning without executing 
the reference point check.

rapid  traverse  rate  (From point A to B) 
(2) Positioning to the reference point from intermediate point at the rapid traverse rate (From 
point B to R) 
(3) If the machine tool is unlocked, the zero return indicator lights up when the reference point 
return is finished. 
 
Points for attention:

I  Programming 
（1）After power on,manual  reference point return hasn't been executed. When execute 
command G28 to return to reference point, the system operates whether alarm or manual 
reference point return through the third bit (AZR) of parameter No.1002, and uses deceleration 
block to return to reference point. However, when use reference point setting function free of 
block,  (the first bit(DLZ) of parameter NO.1002 is 1 or the first bit (DLZx) of parameter NO.1005 
is 1) the setting is not related to AZR,  execute command G28 before setting the reference point, 
the system alarms. 
（2）During the process from the starting point to the intermediate point and from the intermediate 
point to the reference point, each axis moves at its own rapid speed, which is G00 mode;  
（3）In tool radius compensation mode, command G28 or G30,auto cancel tool radius 
compensation, and auto restore the tool radius compensation mode during the next movement 
command.  
（5）Generally, G28 command should be specified in single block; In one block, if G codes ,such 
as G00 or G01, of same axial parameter address character are specified meanwhile, IP_ will be 
specified as parameter of G28 command, but commands G00 or  G01 only changes the 
corresponding mode value of G code group without movement. 
 
2.10.3  Return from Reference Point G29 
Function: When a rapid traverse is performed from the current point to mid point, it positions to the 
specified position by X, Y and Z at the rapid traverse rate.

2.11  Skip Function G31 
Function: during executing the command, when an external skip signal(X3.5) is input, the system 
interrupts the command execution to skip the next block. The function is used to dynamic 
measure(such as milling turning), toolsetting measure of workpiece dimension. 
Format：G31  IP__   F__； 
Explanation: non-modal G code(00 )； 
            its address format is consistent with that of G01, and its use is similar to that of G01. 
            cancel the tool nose radius compensation before using the code;  
            the feedrate is not big to get the precise stop position; 
1.  The  next  block  to  G31  is  incremental  command  1: it  moves  with  incremental  value  
from the  position interrupted by the skip signal. 
 
Example: 
G31 G91 X100.0 F100  ； 
Y50.0  ； 
 
2.  The  next  block  to  G31  is  absolute  command  for  one  axis: 
The 
 
command  
axis  moves  to  the  specified position, and the axis not specified keeps at the skip signal input 
position. 
Example: G31 G90 X200.0 F100  ； 
Y100.0  ； 
 
     3. The next block to G31 is absolute command for 2 axes: 
Wherever the skip signal input is,

I  Programming 
the tool moves to specified position of next block. 
Example: G31 G90 X200.0 F100  ； 
X300.0 Y100.0  ； 
 
Skip signal explanation: 
         skip signal（SKIP）： X3.5  
     Type: input signal 
     Function: X3.5 signal ends the skip cutting. Namely, in the block containing G31, when the skip 
signal becomes "1", the absolute coordinate position is stored in the system macro 
variables (#5061～#5065，the last digit corresponds to the nth axis of the system), at the 
same, the system ends G31 block movement. No.6200 bit1 (SK0) sets the valid input 
state of the skip signal, and when it is set to 0, it is valid. 
     Operation: when the skip signal becomes "1", the CNC executes the followings: when the block 
is executing the skip command G31, the CNC stores the current absolute coordinates of 
each axis. The CNC stops G31 and executes the next block, the skip signal checks its 
state instead of up edge. When the skip signal becomes "1", the system considers  it 
meets immediately skip conditions. 
     Note 1: when a skip signal is input, the feedrate override, dry run, automatic 
acceleration/deceleration is invalid during using skip function to move to improve the tool's 
positioning precision. These function become valid when No.6200 bit7(SKF) is set to 1. 
     Note 2: when the skip signal is valid, the CNC stop axis's feed immediately stops(do not 
execute acceleration/deceleration). So, G31 feedrate should be low as possible to 
improve the stop position precision. 
2.12  Automatic Tool Offset G36, G37  
Function: When the code is executed to make the tool move to the measured position, the CNC  
system automatically measures the difference between the current actual coordinates  
and the code coordinates to be the tool offset value. The function is used to the  
automatic toolsetting.  
Format:  G36 X__;  
 
 
      G37 Z__;  
Explanations: X absolute coordinate(only used to G36), Z absolute coordinate (only used to 
G37);

 GSK988MA/MB Series Milling Center CNC System Programming & Operation User Manual

I  Programming 
 
ZAE(X0.7)  ――――corresponding to G37 
Type: input signal 
Function: When the position measured by the program code is different from that where the tool 
actually reaches (i.e. at the time, the measured position arrival signal becomes the state 
set by No.6240#0), the difference of the coordinates is added to the current tool 
compensation value to update the compensation value. When G36X_(or G37Z_) is 
executed, the tool firstly rapidly traverses to the position γ measured by the code, and 
decelerates and temporarily stop the position before the measured position, and then, 
reaches to the measured position at the speed set by No.6241 (or No.6242). When the 
measured position arrival signal corresponding to G code becomes the state set by No. 
6240#0, and the tool is in the measured position range ±ε, the system updates the offset 
compensation value and ends the block. When the measured position arrival signal does 
not become “1”, and after the tool reaches the measured position distance ε, the CNC 
alarms, ends the block and does not update the offset compensation value.  
 
Fig.2-13-1 
G36, G37 automatic tool offset code use  
From the initial position to the measured position specified by Xa (or Za) in G36(or G37), the tool 
rapidly traverses to A zone and stops at T point (Xa–γx (or Za–γz) , and then traverses to B, C and D 
at the feedrate set by No.6241( or No.6242). The system alarms when the tool traverses in B zone 
and the measured point arrival signal of the end point is set to. The system alarms when the tool 
stops at V point. Parameter No. 6241, No. 6242, No.6254, No.6255 are set by the radius value.

path  (tool  center  path)  =  programmed  path  

tool  radius  (or  diameter)  (determined by 
compensation direction). 
 
Note: 
 
Compensation operation is executed in the plane selected by G17, G18, G19. For 
example, when XY plane is selected, (X,Y) or (I, J) is used to carry out compensation 
operation and vector operation. The coordinate value whose axis in not in the 
compensation plane is not affected by the compensation.  
 
In 3-axis linkage control, compensation only performed for the tool path projected on 
the compensation plane.  
 
The alteration of compensation plane should be executed posterior to the 
compensation mode cancelled. Otherwise, the system will give an alarm and machine 
stops.

When the cutter compensation is cancelled by G40, movement amount should be 
specified, otherwise, an alarm will occur.

The  end  point  specified  by  Z  axis  moves  an  offset  value,  as  above  figure  G17  
plane  is  selected.  Difference between supposed and actual machined tool length value is pre-set at 
the offset storage when the program is applied. Different  length  tool  can  be  employed  by  
changing  tool  length  compensation  value,  so,  program  change  is  not needed. 
Different offset directions were specified by G43 and G44, the offset number is specified by H 
code.

G18 G43 H_ ; …Y axis offset, composed with the previous block, X and Y axes are 
compensated. 
Offset direction 
G43: Positive offset 
G44: Negative offset 
Compensation  axes  can  be  regarded  as  Z,  Y  and  X.  Either  absolute  or  
incremental  command,  the  end  point coordinate value specified by Z axis movement command 
in program adds the offset specified by H codes in G43 (set in the offset storage), or subtracts the 
offset specified by H code in G44, finally, the value calculated is regarded as the end point coordinate. 
The following command is indicated for Z axis move omitting: When the offset is positive, G43 is 
for an offset in the positive direction; G44 is for an offset in the negative direction. 
It reversely moves when the offset is negative value. 
Specifying the offset 
An  offset  number  is  specified  by  H  code  and  its  corresponding  offset  adds  
or  subtracts  Z  axis  movement command value in program to get a new Z axis movement 
command value. The offset number is H00~H32. 
Offset value corresponded with offset number is pre-set in the offset storage by using the panel 
of LCD/MDI. Setting range for offset is as follows: 
Offset value: -9999999～9999999×least input increment  
Offset number 00, i.e. H00 corresponds to the 0 offset. It is disabled to set offset value to H00. 
Tool length compensation cancellation 
G49 or H00 can be specified when the tool length compensation is cancelled. When two or 
more axes compensations are cancelled, all of the axes compensation will be cancelled if the G49 
is applied. Compensation value of the vertical axis for currently specified plane is cancelled with 
H00. After G49 or H00 is specified, the system immediately cancels the compensation value. 
Note 1: In the block that tool length compensation is specified, G02，G03, G04, G92 ，G31，G142 and G143 cannot 
be specified at the same time, otherwise, an alarm will occur.

2.15  Relevant Functions of Coordinate System 
The tool position is expressed with a coordinate value of the coordinate system. GSK988MA/MB 
system has three kind of coordinate system:   
1. machine coordinate system, 2. workpiece coordinate system, 3. local coordinate system  
Fig.2-20 describes the relationship of the three coordinate systems: 
 
Fig.2-20 
 
Note1: The system has created the above coordinate system after the reference point return is executed firstly. The 
coordinate system is created after the system is turned on with the absolute position encoder. 
2.15.1  Setting Local Coordinate System G52 
For easy programming, during programming in the work piece coordinate system, the 
REF 
Reference position. 
M0 
Origin of machine coordinate system is a fixed point on the machine, No. 1240 value 
confirms the relative position of the reference position and the machine origin. 
M2 
The 2nd reference position, No.1214 set the 2nd reference position in the machine 
coordinate system. 
EXT 
The outer origin offset can be set by No. 1220 or in the coordinate setting window. 
G50 
The offset set by G50 is 0 when the system is turned on. 
G54, 
59 
The offset of the workpiece coordinate system is set by No. 1221, No. 1226, and is 
also set in the coordinate window. 
W0-54, 
W0-59 
Origin of the workpiece coordinate system. 
G52
The offset of the local coordinate system is 0 when the system is switched on. All 
workpiece coordinate systems share, i.e. the local coordinate system offset set in one 
workpiece coordinate system can exist in other workpiece coordinate system.

subcoordinate system of the work piece coordinate system can be set, which is also called as part 
coordinate system. 
Function: In program, command G52 can set part coordinate system in work piece coordinate 
systems G54～G59. The origin of the part coordinate system is set in the position 
specified by IP_ in the work piece coordinate system.

Fig.2-16-2 
Format:  G52 IP__；set part coordinate system  
     …… 
G52 IP0；cancel part coordinate system 
Explanation：G52 is non-mode command G； 
IP_: When IP_ is the absolute command, it specifies the part coordinate system origin at 
the absolute coordinate value in the work piece coordinate system; when IP_ is increment 
command, it specifies the relative coordinate value of the part coordinate system origin 
relative to the work piece coordinate system origin;  
    Once the part coordinate system is set, its coordinate can be the traverse command 
of axis. When G52 commands the zero point of the new part coordinate system (in work 
piece coordinate system),  the position of the part coordinate system can be changed;    
If cancel the part coordinate system and return to the work piece coordinate system, it just 
requires the zero points of the part coordinate system and that of work piece coordinate 
system coincide, namely, command G52 X0 Z0 
attention 
（1）Setting the part coordinate system doesn't change the coordinate systems of work piece 
and machine; 
（2）Command G52 can cancel the offset of nose radius compensation temporarily;  
（3）In part coordinate system, when command G50 sets the work piece coordinate system, if 
not all axes are specified with the coordinate values in the part coordinate system, the axes 
which are not specified in G50 remain unchanged in part coordinate system, then the part 
coordinate system relative to the axis commanded by G50 is canceled; such as: 
 …… 
    G52 X50 Z50; 
   …… 
    G50 X100; the coordinate value in Z axis of part coordinate system remains unchanged,but 
the part coordinate system relative to X axis is canceled.  
     …… 
（4）In the part coordinate system, if the work piece coordinate system commands (G54～G59) 
change the work piece coordinate system, the part coordinate system also trasfers to the new 
work piece coordinate system.  
（5）During resetting, whether cancel the part coordinate system is set by the third bit (RLC) of 


Chapter 2  G Codes

parameter NO.1202; when the parameter is set as 1, the part coordinate system is canceled 
during resetting.  
（6）During manually return to reference point, whether cancel the part coordinate system is set 
by the second bit (ZCL) of parameter NO.1201; when the parameter is set as 1, cancel the part 
coordinate system during manually return to reference point. 
2.15.2  Select Machine Coordinate System G53 
A particular on the machine as the machining reference is called the machine zero which is taken 
as the origin of the coordinate system is called as the machine coordinate system. After the system is 
turned on, executing the manual reference position return sets the machine coordinate system which 
keeps till the system is turned off. 
Command function: when the position of the machine coordinate system is codeed, the tool 
traverses to the position at the rapid traverse speed.  
Command format: G53  IP   ;  
Command explanation: G53 is non-modal;  
IP_: coordinate values of each axis in the machine coordinate system must bespecified by the 
absolute value.  
Execution process: As the following figure: the specified axis rapidly moves from A (10, 20) in the 
current workpiece coordinate system to point B (-8, -10) in the machine 
coordinate system.

attention:  
   （1）G53 command is non-mode, only valid in the block with its own command;  
   （2）G53 command is the absolute position value in machine coordinate system. When 
some axis is commanded by increment value, the axial commands are ignored;  
   （3）If command G53, the nose radius compensation is canceled;  
   （4）After power on, complete manually return to reference point or G28 auto returns to 
reference point, the system auto sets the position of machine coordinate system origin 
based on the value set by parameter NO.1240.  
   （5）Machine coordinate system must be set before command G53; therefore,after 
power on, manually return to reference point must be executed or G28 auto returns to 
reference point; while use absolute position encoder, it doesn't require;

G56  workpiece coordinate system 3； 
G57  workpiece coordinate system 4； 
G58  workpiece coordinate system 5； 
G59  workpiece coordinate system 6 
Explanation: G54～G59 are modal.  
Note 1: A workpiece coordinate system is valid after a reference point is created.  
       When the system is turned on, No.1201 Bit 5 (EWZ) sets to memery the workpiece coordinate system or 
not. When EWZ is set to not to memory, the workpiece coordinate system defaults to G54 after power-on.  
       When reset, No.1201 Bit7 (WZR) sets the system returns to G54 workpiece coordinate system or not. But 
when No.3402 Bit 6(CLR) is set to 1, the mode in the group also returns to G54. 
Note 2: G54-G59 describing the 6 workpiece coordinate systems can change their positions by the external 
workpiece zero offset value or workpiece zero offset value, and their relationship is as Fig.2-16-5;

Note 3: Use the following method to change: 
1）MDI input changes the workpiece coordinate system zero;  
2）Use G50 to move the workpiece coordinate system;  
 
Specifying G50 IP_ makes the workpiece coordinate system（G54～G59）to set a new workpiece coordinate 
system where the current tool position is consistent with the specified coordinates. When G50 specifies the 
relative value, the value adding the previous tool position coordinate value creates a new coordinate system, but 
the tool position does not change but the coordinate system executes the offset as Fig. 2-16-6:  
 
Fig.2-16-6 
Note 4: The coordinate offset value created by G50 adds to the one of all workpiece zero to make ensure that all 
workpiece coordinate systems offset are the same value as Fig. 2-16-7:

Note 5: The workpiece zero offset value of G54～G59 workpiece coordinate system can be set in the parameters 
and input in the coordinate setting window; 
2.15.4  Additional Workpiece Coordinate System G54.1

When P command and G54.1(G54) are executed in the same block, a corresponding workpiece 
coordinate system in additional workpiece coordinates is selected. The selected workpiece 
coordinate system is valid till it is replaced by another one.  
When the system is started again, the defaulted workpiece coordinate system is controlled by 
SCRD of No.540. 
 
Restrictions:  
After G54.1, P must be specified, the workpiece coordinate system 1 （G54.1 P1）is defaulted 
when P following G54.1 is not specified in the same block.   
P/S alarm occurs when the specified command value in P command exceeds 1~48.

2.16  Exact Stop Mode G61/Cutting Mode G64 
G61 function: the programmed axis of a block must exactly stop at the end point of the block, and 
the system continuously executes a next block.  
G64 function: the system executes a next block while the programmed axis of each block after 
G64 starts to decelerate (the axis does not reach the programmed end point). 
The programmed contour in G64 mode is different from the actual contour, and 
the different degrees is determined by F value and the angle between two paths, 
bigger their difference is, F value is bigger. 
Command format: G61; （exact stop mode） 
G64; （cutting mode, defaulted to default value） 
Command explanations: 
1. A block including G61 exactly stops the end point of the program before the system executes 
the next block, which is used to process sharp edges and corners. G61 is modal and valid 
before G64 is codeed. The programmed contour is the same that of the actual.  
2. G64 is modal, valid and default before G61 is codeed. G64 path is different from that of G61 as 
Fig. 2-17-1;  
3. G61, G64 belong to Group 15, and their relations with other G groups are referred to Group 5. 
4. When G0 is executed, it is in the exact stop in cutting mode because it is non cutting code.  
5. When G61 /G64 is specified, it is value in the next codeed block.

G91;          Incremental command 
Function:  
There are two kinds of modes for commanding axis offset, one is absolute command the other is 
incremental command. The absolute command is programmed by coordinate value of the terminal 
position by the axis movement. The incremental command is directly programmed by the movement 
value of the axis. They are separately specified by G90 and G91 commands. 
Example:

2.18  Workpiece Coordinate System Setting G92 
Format：G92  X   Y   Z  ；

position in the system (It is also called floating coordinate system). After the workpiece coordinate is 
set, the coordinate value is input in absolute programming in this coordinate system till the new 
workpiece coordinate system is set by G92. 
Command explanation:  G92, which is a non-modal G-command; 
X:  The new X axis absolute coordinate of current position; 
Y:  The new Y axis absolute coordinate of current position; 
Z:  The new Z axis absolute coordinate of current position;

Note: In G92 command, current coordinate value will be not changed if the X, Y and Z are not input, the program zero 
is set by the current coordinate value. When the X, Y or Z is not input, the coordinate axis not input keeps 
on the original set value. 
2.19  Feed per min. G94, Feed per rev. G95 
Format:   G94 Fxxxx; (F0001~ F8000, the leading zero can be omitted, the feedrate per min. is 
offered, mm/min.) 
Function:  The cutting feedrate is offered in mm/min unit when the G94 is modal G command. 
The G94 can be omitted if the current mode is G94. 
Format:  G95 Fxxxx;    (F0.0001～F500, The leading zero can be omitted） 
Command Function:  The cutting feedrate is offered in mm/rev unit when the G95 is modal G 
command. The G95 can be omitted if the current mode is G95. The product of F 
command value (mm/r) and current spindle speed(r/min) is regarded as the 
command cutting feedrate to control the actual feedrate when the G95 Fxxxx is 
performed by system. The actual cutting feedrate varies with the spindle speed. The 
spindle cutting feed value per rev is specified by G95 Fxxxx, it can form even cutting 
grain on the surface of the workpiece. The machine should be installed spindle 
encoder when the G95 mode is used.  
G94 and G95 are modal G commands in same group, one of them is effective in one time. G94 is 
initial modal G command, it is defaulted effective when the power is turned on. 
The conversion formula for feed value per rev and per min is as following:  
Fm = Fr×S 
Fm:  Feed value per min (mm/min); 
Fr:  Feed value per rev per rev (mm/r); 
S:  Spindle speed (r/min). 
 
Note 1: G94, G95 are the modal G commands in the same group and only one is valid. The system defaults the modal 
can be set by No.3402 Bit4 (FPM) when the system turns on;  
Note 2: In G95 mode, there is the uneven cutting feed rate when the spindle speed is lower than 1 r/min; there is the 
follow error in the actual cutting feed rate when there is the swing in the spindle speed. To gain the high 
machining quality, it is recommended that the selected spindle speed should be not lower than min. speed of 
spindle servo or converter; 
Note 3: No.1422 set the upper of the cutting feedrate. When the actual cutting feedrate (the value is multiplied by the 
override) exceeds the specified upper limit, it is clamped to the upper limit value; 
Note 4: No. 1403 Bit0(MIF)can set the cutting speed unit per minute and the detailed is referred to Ⅱ Operation; 
Note 5: When G95 instead of F command in G94 mode is commanded, F is the previous modal value in G95. In a 
similar way, when G94 instead of F command in G95 mode is commanded, F is the previous modal value in 
G94; 
Note 6: When the initial mode is G94/95, and G99/G98 is alone executed after power on, the system runs at the speed 
set by No. 1411 
2.20  Constant Surface Speed Control G96, Constant Rotational Speed

Relative code: G50 
Command function: define max. spindle speed limit (r/min) in the constant surface speed 
control(r/min). 
Command format:  G50 Sxxxx;  
Command explanation: After the system is turned on, and the max. spindle speed is not specified, 
the system does not limit the spindle speed state. Max. spindle speed limit is 
valid for G96, and is invalid for G97;  
S value set by G50 is modal and is value before the new max. speed 
is set;  
Note: when G50 S0 is executed, the spindle speed is limited in 0 r/min 
(the spindle does not rotate) in the constant surface control;

When the machine tool cuts it, the workpiece rotates based on the axes of spindle as the center 
line, the cutting point of tool cutting workpiece is a circle motion around the axes of spindle, and the 
instantaneous speed in the circle tangent direction is called the cutting surface speed (for short 
surface speed). There are different surface speed for the different workpiece and tool with different 
material. 
When the spindle speed controlled by the analog voltage is valid, the constant surface control is 
valid. The spindle speed is changed along with the absolute value of X absolute coordinate of 
programming path in the constant speed control. If the absolute value of X absolute coordinate 
increases, the spindle speed reduces, and vice versa, which make the cutting surface speed as S 
code value. The constant speed control to cut the workpiece makes sure all smooth finish on the 
surface of workpiece with diameter changing. 
Surface speed=spindle speed× |X| × π ÷1000  (m/min)     
Spindle speed: r/min  
|X|: absolute value of X absolute coordinate value (diameter value)    π≈3.14

In G96, the spindle speed is changed along with the absolute value of programming path X 
absolute coordinate value in the course of cutting feed (interpolation), but it is not changed in G00 
because there is no actual cutting and is counted based on the surface speed of end point in the 
program block. 
In G96, Z coordinates axis of workpiece system must consist with the axes of spindle (rotary axis 
of workpiece), otherwise, there is different between the actual surface speed and the defined one. 
When the constant surface speed is valid, G50 Sxxxxx can limit max. spindle speed (r/min). The 
actual spindle speed is the limit value of max. speed when the spindle speed counted by the surface 
speed and X coordinate value is more than the max. spindle speed set by G50 Sxxxxx. After the 
system powers on, max. spindle speed limit value is not defined and its function is invalid. Max. 
spindle speed limit value defined by G50 Sxxxxx is reserved before it is defined again and its function 
is valid in G96. Max. spindle speed defined by G50 Sxxxxx is invalid in G97 but its limit value is 
reserved. 
 
Note 1: G96, G97 are modal in the same group, and one of them is valid in the same time. G97 is initial word and is 
valid after the system is turned on.  
Note 2: In G96, S value codeed is reserved in G97. there is no new S is codeed and the S value in the last G96 state is 
recovered to the current valid surface speed after the system returns to G96 state, the system outputs the 
least surface speed in G96 when there is no saved value.  
Note 3: From G96 to G97, if none of S code (r/min) is codeed in the program block in G97, the last spindle speed in 
G96 is taken as S code in G97, namely, the spindle speed is not changed at this time;  
Note 4: The constant surface speed control function is still valid when the machine is locked(X, Z do not move when 
the system executes X, Z motion codes);  
Note 5: In G96, when the spindle speed counted by the cutting surface speed is more than max. speed of current 
spindle gear, at this time, the spindle speed is limited to max. one of current spindle gear; 
Note 6: In thread cutting, To gain the precise thread machining, it should not be adopted with the constant surface 
speed control but the constant rotational speed (G97) in the course of thread cutting;  
Note 7: No.3031 sets the numerical digit permitted by S.  
Note 8: X=0: the theory speed is infinite but the actual speed corresponds to 10V voltage because the maximum 
voltage of sent analog is 10V.

2.22.1  Brief for Canned Cycle 
Generally, the canned cycle is a machining movement completion from one block with G function 
to the completion of multi-block specified. Canned cycles make it easier for the programmer to create 
programs. With a canned cycle, a frequently used machining operation can be specified in a single 
block with a G function; without canned cycles, multiple blocks are needed, and canned cycles can 
shorten the program to save memory.

Canned circle explanations 
Generally, a canned cycle consists of a sequence of the following operations, see the right 
figure. 
 
Fig.2-23-1-1 
2.22.1.1  G90/G91 
The data mode corresponded with G90 and G91 are different. The point R plane and the 
absolute position machined at the bottom of the hole are specified by R and Z values, when the 
command is G 90. The specified R value is the distance relative to the initial plane, and the Z value is 
the distance relative to the R point plane when the command is G91. See the following figure. 
 
Fig. 2-23-1-2 Absolute and incremental commands for canned cycle 
2.22.1.2  Returning point level G98/G99 
Tool can be returned to the initial plane or point R plane according to G98 and G99 during 
returning. See the following figure Fig. 2-23-1-3. 
Normally, the initial hole machining is used by G99, the last machining is used with G98. The 
initial level will not be changed when the hole machining is done by G99.

Fig.2-23-1-3  Levels for initial and point R 
Note ：The initial point level is an absolute position for hole machining axis direction which is indicated from the 
canned cycle cancellation to start. 
The middle hole returning to initial plane or plane R is determined by No. 582 BRCH when the system executes 
continuous drilling holes. 
2.22.1.3  Canned cycle cancellation 
There are two ways for canned cycle cancel are listed below:  
1. Canceling the canned cycle with the G80. 
2. The canned cycle is cancelled by the G00, G01, G02 and G03 command in group 01. 
(1) When the canned cycle is cancelled by the command G80, if the G00, G01, G02 and G03 of 
the 01 group are not specified, then the reserved modal command (G00 or G01) performs motion 
before using canned cycle.  
For example:   
N0010 G01 X0 Y0 Z0 F800;  （The modal command is G01 before entering the canned cycle） 
N0020 G81 X10 Y10 R5 Z-50;    （Entering canned cycle） 
N0030 G80 X100 Y100 Z100;    (The modal G01 command reserved before canned cycle 
performs cutting feed ） 
If the G01 is not specified in the abovementioned program N0010, but G00, the G00 performs 
rapid positioning for N0030. 
When both command G80 and commands G00, G01, G02 and G03 are specified in block, 
actions are performed by the latter, G00, G01, G02 and G03. 
For example:   
N0010 G01 X0 Y0 Z0 F800;    (The modal command is G01 before entering the canned cycle) 
N0020 G81 X10 Y10 R5 Z-50;      (Entering canned cycle) 
N0030 G00 G80 X100 Y100 Z100; (The G00 performs positioning at the rapid rate, and the 
modal command G00 is saved) 
Note: The cutting feedrate by F command is still held on even if the canned cycle is cancelled.  
2.22.1.4  General command format for canned cycle 
Once the hole machining data is specified in the canned cycle, it is held until the canned cycle is 
cancelled. So the hole machining data should be outright specified at the beginning of the canned 
cycle, only the modified data is specified in the following canned cycle. 
The general command format of canned cycle:  G_  X_  Y_  R_  Z_  Q_  P_  F_  L; 
All commands for canned cycle are listed in above-mentioned format. But it is not needed to specify 
the above-mentioned format in each canned cycle. For example, the canned cycle can be performed

as long as the G command (hole machining) and any of X, Y, Z and R are specified; additionally, Q or 
P is not available in some canned cycle G command (hole machining), the command is disabled even

feed to the bottom of a hole, and eliminating the chips from the hole simultaneously. 
Explanation:  Refer to the command explanation of canned cycle in Table 3-2. 
Cycle process:  
(1) Positioning to XY plane level at the rapid traverse; 
(2) Down to the point R plane at the rapid traverse rate; 
(3) Cutting feed for Q distance; 
(4) Retract d distance in rapid traverse; 
(5) Cutting feed for (Q+d) distance 
(6) Machine to the Z axis hole bottom by cycling the (4) and (5);

Fig.2-23-2-1 
Related Explanation:  
(1) This kind of cycle is peck drilling for Q value intermittent feeding along the Z-axis direction. 
The Q value should be positive, the sign is ineffective even if the negative value is specified. If the Q 
value is not specified, then it defaults 0.1mm. If a depth to be cut is less than the Q value, then cut to 
the bottom of the hole without tool retraction at the rapid traverse for the first time. 
(2) To remove chips from the hole easily, a small value can be set for retraction. This allows 
drilling to be performed efficiently. The tool is retracted in rapid feed, the retraction amount d is set by 
parameter No.5114, the default is 1000, unit:  0.001mm. 
(3) The command P is disabled, but its value is reserved as canned cycle modal value 
 
 
 
2.22.2.2  Left-handed Tapping Cycle G74

Function:  This cycle performs left-handed tapping. In the left-handed tapping cycle, the spindle 
rotates clockwise for tapping till the bottom of the hole has been reached, then retracts 
by counter-clockwise after dwell. 
Explanation:  For canned cycle explanation, see the Table 2-23-1-2 
Thereinto, the F is indicated for tooth pitch. The value range are indicated as 0.001~500.00mm 
(metric), 0.06~25400 teeth/inch (inch) 
 
Cycle process:  
(1) Positioning to XY plane level at the rapid traverse; 
(2) Down to the point R plane at the rapid traverse; 
(3) Tapping to the bottom of a hole; 
(4) The spindle stops; 
(5) Pause for time P if dwell is specified; 
(6) The spindle rotates CCW, and then retracts to point R plane; 
(7) The spindle is stopped; pause for time P if dwell is specified;

(9) Return to the initial plane if it is G98. 
 
Command Path:  
 
Fig.2-23-2-2 
Command explanation:  
     （1）the cycle operation is executed by G74 block containing Z（W）and Q（∆k）. When a block 
has no Z（W）, G74 is not executed. When only “G74 R（e）；” block is executed，only NO.5139 value 
is modified, and the cycle operation does not perform;  
     （2）∆d  and e are specified by the address R, their difference is according to whether there is 
Z（W）and Q（∆k）or not in the block; 
     （3）during executing G74, can stop automatic run and manually move. But return to the 
position which is before executing manually moving, and then execute G74 again. The following fun 
path is dislocation when a return is not executed to continuously perform. 
     （4）for executing a single block operation,the program stops after the system completes the 
current one-time cutting cycle and arrives the end of the cutting path. 
     （5）when the system performs blind hole cutting, R（∆d）must be ignoreeed,because there is 
no tool retraction distance to axial cutting end point.

Related explanation:  
 (1) This cycle is used to be bore a hole. The command operation is basically same with G81, 
only spindle rotation status is different. After cut feeds to the bottom of a hole, the M05 is executed 
(spindle stops), then the point R plane is retracted at the rapid traverse, the M03 is then performed 
(spindle rotates positively) regardless of the currently spindle rotation status and the positive or 
negative rotation are specified before the canned cycle. 
(2) The command Q and P are disabled in this cycle, but its value is reserved as canned cycle modal 
value.

Related explanation：  
（1）Q value must be positive, i.e. the negative value is commanded, the sign is invalid; when Q value 
is not commanded or Q0 is commanded, Q value is defaulted to 0.1mm; Q value is modal, it can be 
used in other fixed cycle commands, and the Q value cannot be big, otherwise, the tool retraction 
operation can hit the workpiece, so Q value must be specified to the small.

Note 1: If the G140 or G141 is specified in the canned cycle, it is indicated that the rectangle serial punching will be 
performed. The rectangle data are defined according to specified X, Y coordinates and J value in a program, 
and the serial punching cycle is performed according to the punch mode (canned cycle command). 
Note 2: The command value of maximum punching number A and B at each side is 9999; the command is disabled 
when it is negative. The decimal part will be rounded off if the command is decimal; if the A or B is not specified, 
then 0 is a default. 
Note 3: The rectangle is defined by the current start point, the end of the 1st side and the length of the 2nd side; the 
default is current start point if the end of 1st side is not specified; the alarm will be generated if the length 
(namely, the J is not specified) of 2nd side is not specified.  
Note 4: The returned levels are all R point plane in serial punching, the corresponding plane will be retracted according

2.22.4  Cautions for Canned Cycle 
(1) The spindle should be rotated (The M code should be correctly specified, or, the alarm will be 
generated, the G74 by M04, G84 by M03) by using the miscellaneous function (M code) before the 
canned cycle is executed. 
 (2) Specifying any command of the X, Y, Z and R data, the hole machining can be performed in 
the canned cycle of G73~G89. If neither data is contained in the block, the hole machining is not 
performed (G110, G111, G112, G113, G114, G115, G134, G135, G136, G137, G138 and G139 are 
still needed to specify the corresponding address I, J and K, or the alarm occurs). But the hole 
machining is not performed when the G04 X_ is specified in the circumstance of X, because the X 
indicates for time when the G04 is specified. 
G00 X_;                      (G00 rapid positioning) 
G81 X_ Y_ Z_ R_ F_ L_;       (Hole machining performs) 
;                            (Without hole machining) 
F_ ;                         (F value is refreshed without the hole machining) 
M_ ;                         (Performing the miscellaneous function only) 
 (3) When the canned cycle (G74 or G84) is employed in spindle rotation consolation, if the hole 
position (X, Y) or distance from initial point level to the point R plane is short, and it is necessary to 
machine serially, or sometimes the spindle can not reach the specified speed before the hole 
machining operation, for delaying the time, the dwell block by G04 is inserted into each hole 
machining, which is shown as follows:  
 
Fig.2-23-4-1 
G86 X_ Y_ Z_ R_ F_ ； 
G04 P _;             (For dwell time P, without hole machining) 
X_ Y_;               (The next hole is machined) 
G04 P _;             (For dwell time P, without hole machining) 
X_ Y_;               (The next hole is machined) 
G04 P_;              (For dwell time P, without hole machining) 
Sometimes, this issue will not be considered according to different machine tool, refer to the 
manual supplied by the machine tool builder. 
 (4) As stated above, the canned cycle can also be cancelled only when G00~G03 codes are 
read. So, there are two cases (# expresses for 0~3, □□ for canned cycle code) will be shown 
when they share the same block with the canned cycle G code.  
G# G□□ X- Y- Z- R- Q- P- F- K-;    (For canned cycle) 
G□□ G# X- Y- Z- R- Q- P- F- K-; The X, Y and Z axes are moved by G#, the R, P, Q and K are 
disabled, the F is stored. The principle, which the last G code is effective when G codes of same 
group share the same block, is met by cases above.  
 (5) When the canned cycle and miscellaneous function are specified at the same block, The M

I  Programming 
 
and MF codes are delivered at the beginning of positioning (see the operation 1). The next hole 
machining can be performed till the ending signal (FIN) occurs. 
 (6) When the canned cycle is applied, if the tool compensation C is current state, the tool 
compensation information C is then temporarily cancelled and saved; the tool compensation C status 
is restored when the canned cycle is cancelled. 
 (7) If the tool length offset commands (G43, G44 and G49) are specified in a canned cycle block. 
Then, the offset is performed when the point R plane is positioned (operation 2). The tool length 
offset commands are disabled after the canned cycle is entered till it is cancelled. 
 (8) The cautions for the operation of canned cycle:  
a. Single block 
When the canned cycle operation is performed by using the single block mode, normally, it is 
separately stopped at the terminal of the movements 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 in the Fig. 13.1 (A). And the 
single block is somewhat different according to corresponding canned cycle action at the bottom of a 
hole. For example, the single block is stopped when the dwell is applied. The operation at the bottom 
of the hole for fine-milling and rough-milling are divided into multiple single stop. So, it is necessary to 
startup for several times to machine a hole in a single block.  
b. Feed hold 
The feed hold is disabled between the movement 3 ~ 5 in commands G74 and G84, but the 
indicator of feed hold will light up. But the control stops till the operation 6. If the feed hold is 
performed again in operation 6, then it is stopped immediately. 
c. Override 
The feedrate override is considered for 100 percent in the operation G74 and G84, the override 
change is disabled. 
(9) When the bit 1 of parameter 3 (D_R) is set to 1, the D value in tool compensation page 
indicates diameter value.

2.23  Rigid Tapping 
The right-handed tapping cycle (G84) and left-handed tapping cycle (G74) may be performed in 
standard mode or rigid tapping mode. In standard mode, the spindle is rotated and stopped along with 
a movement along the tapping axis using miscellaneous functions M03 (rotating the spindle 
clockwise), M04 (rotating the spindle counterclockwise), and M05 (stopping the spindle) to perform 
tapping. 
In rigid mode, tapping is performed by controlling the spindle motor as if it were a servo 
motor and by interpolating between the tapping axis and spindle. When tapping is 
performed in rigid mode, the spindle rotates one turn every time a certain feed (thread 
lead) which takes place along the tapping axis. This operation does not vary even during 
acceleration or deceleration. 
 
2.23.1  Rigid Tapping 
Code format: 
Left-handed rigid tapping: G74 X_ Y_ Z_ R_ P_ F_Q_ K_ 
Right-handed rigid tapping: G84 X_ Y_ Z_ R_ P_ F_ Q_ K_ 
Code function: In rigid mode, tapping is performed by controlling the spindle motor as if it were a 
servo motor and by interpolating between the tapping axis and spindle. When 
tapping is performed in rigid mode, the spindle rotates one turn every time a certain 
feed (thread lead) which takes place along the tapping axis. This operation does not 
vary even during acceleration or deceleration. 
Cycle process: (1) Position to the XY plane at the rapid traverse rate; 
             (2) Reduce to the point R plane rapidly, then to the position where the C is specified at 
the rapid traverse rate; 
             (3) Tapping is performed to the bottom of the hole, then the spindle stops; 
             (4) Dwell time P is performed if the P is specified; 
             (5) Spindle rotates reversely returns to the point R plane, the spindle then stops; dwell 
time P is performed if the P is specified; 
   (6) Return to the origin plane if the command is G98;

2.23.2  Peck Rigid Tapping 
Code format: 
 (High-speed/standard) peck left-handed rigid tapping: G74 X_ Y_ Z_ R_ P_ F_ Q_ K_ 
    (High-speed/standard) peck right-handed rigid tapping: G84 X_ Y_ Z_ R_ P_ F_Q_ K_ 
Code function: When the peck tapping is performed in rigid tapping, due to chips sticking to the tool or 
increased cutting resistance, in such cases, the preferable tapping can be performed by the 
peck rigid tapping. 
High-speed peck rigid tapping: 
When the PCP of state parameter No.5200#5 is set to 0, the high-speed peck rigid tapping cycle 
is selected. 
After positioning along the X- and Y-axes, rapid traverse is performed to point R, then position to 
the place where specifies by C. From point R, cutting is performed with depth Q (depth of cut for each 
cutting feed), then the tool is retracted by distance d, the retraction speed can be overridden. When 
point Z has been reached, the spindle is stopped, and then rotated in the reverse direction for 
retraction. The tool retracts to the point R, the spindle stops. If it is G98 state, rapidly move to the 
initial position, the Figure is shown below:

The tapping feed axis is specified based upon the parameter FXY (Bit 0 of Para.No.5101). Which 
spindle can be used that is determined by the relevant G signal (It is related with the PLC program of 
the system operation). 
The thread leading can be affirmed by the cutting federate F (the federate of tapping axis) and 
spindle speed S. 
In per minute mode, thread lead =command cutting feedrate /spindle speed.  
In per rotation mode, thread lead =command feedrate. 
In rigid tapping mode, the system can select three kind of machining mode by Q value (cutting 
amount every time) and PCP (NO.5200#): Standard rigid tapping cycle, high-speed deep hole rigid 
tapping cycle, and deep hold rigid tapping cycle.

The resetting can be reset the tapping when the rigid tapping is performed, but the G74/G84 can 
be not be reset. 
Dwell 
The dwell is disabled. 
Working 
G84/G74 is only valid in Auto or MDI mode. 
Manual feed 
The rigid tapping can not used for manual feed. 
Tool length compensation 
If the tool length compensation (G43, G44 or G49) is specified in canned cycle, the offset value is 
added till position to the point R. 
Cutter compensation 
 
Cutter compensation is ignored in canned cycle.

P/Q 
 
If they are specified in non-drilling block (If they are specified in a block that does not perform 
drilling), they are not stored as modal data. When Q0 is specified, the peck rigid tapping cycle is not 
performed. 
Specify them in tapping block, they are stored as modal data, when the tapping command is 
retracted, either Q modal (did it). 
Cancellation 
 
Do not specify a group 01 G code and G84/G74 in the same block. 
A Cs contour control is used with rigid tapping at the same time. 
   
CS axis selects a speed mode or position mode which is determined by CON (G27.7), but, 
the system is rigid tapping mode, regardless of the value of CON. After the rigid tapping is 
cancelled, the rotation axis is either CS axis or common one which is determined by state 
parameter. The C axis can not be moved in manual mode when the rigid tapping is not 
cancelled.

2.23.6  F and G Signals 
RGTAP (G61.0): Rigid tapping signal 
 
When the M 29 is commanded, PMC enters the rigid tapping mode, and the signal is then set to 
1 to inform the CNC 
 
1: PMC enters the rigid tapping mode 
 
0: PMC does not enter the rigid tapping mode 
 
If this signal does not set to 1, after the M29 has been commanded, the alarm may occur in the 
block of G74/G84. 
RGSPM, RGSPP (F65.1, 0) spindle turning signal 
 
When the rigid tapping is performed, the signal is informed to the PMC whether the current 
spindle is CCW (positive) or CW (negative). 
 
RGSPM: 1 spindle CW (negative) 
RGSPP: 1 spindle CCW (positive) 
 
In rigid tapping, these signals are output when the spindle is rotated. In the mode of rigid tapping, 
when the spindle is positioned at the hole or stopped at the bottom of the hole or R position, these 
signals are not output. 
In the mode of rigid tapping, when the spindle is positioned at the inter-locked stop, machine lock 
or Z axis ignorance states, the spindle does not regard as a stop state, in this case, these signals are 
output. These signals are only enabled in rigid tapping, and they are all set to 0 in the normal spindle 
control mode. 
RTAP (F76.3): Rigid tapping process signal 
 
This signal informs PMC which has been in the mode of rigid tapping or not. The CNC is in the 
mode of rigid tapping currently when the signal is set to 1. 
 
This signal can be locked M29, PLC has been commanded the rigid tapping mode, the PMC is 
then treated with the corresponding logic, and this signal can be replaced the lock of M29, even so, 
the FIN signal of M29 is not ignored still.

2.24  Macro Code 
GSK988MA provides the macro code which is similar to the high language, and can realize the 
variable assignment, and subtract operation, logic decision and conditional jump by user macro code, 
contributed to compiling part program for special workpiece, reduce the fussy counting and simplify 
the user program. 
2.24.1  Variable 
（1）variable use 
The variable can specify the address value in the program. The variable value is assigned 
by the program code or is set directly by the keyboard. One program can use many variables 
which can be distinguished by their variable number.  
 
Variable expression 
Use “#”+variable number to express;  
Format：# i（i=200，202，203，……）； 
Example：#205，#209，#225. 
Besides, the expression can be used to specify the variable number. At the moment, the 
expression must be in the brackets.  
Example：#[#20+#30/4] 
 
Variable reference  
1. Use variable to permute the number following address. 
Format: ﹤address﹥+“# i” or ﹤address﹥+“－# i” means to take the variable value or 
the negative value of value of the variable as the address value. 
Example: F#203…#203=15: it is the same those of F15 functions; 
Z-#210…#210=250: it is the same those of Z-250 functions; 
G#230…#230=3: it is the same those of G3 functions. 
When the variable value is used in program, the decimal point can be omitted. Example: 
#1=123: the actual value of #1 is 123.000.  
When the variable value followed the axis code address has the decimal point, the data 
less than the least setting unit executes the rounding. For example: #1=1.23456; the axis 
least setting unit is 0.001, the tool to execute G00 X#1 positions to 1.235 position.  
 
2. Use variable to permute variable number. 
Format: “#”+[variable number] 
Example: 5 uses #30 to execute the permutation in #5, is written to #[#30]. 
3. Refer the undefined variable. 
When the variable is not defined, it becomes the “Null” variable. When the variable #0 is 
Null, it is only read instead of being written.  
When the system refers to the undefined variable, it ignores the variable and the word.  
Example: when the variable #10 value is 0, the variable #!1 value is Null and the system 
executes G00 X#10 Y#11, the execution result is G00 X0，Y#11 to be ignored.  
 In course of operation, besides using null variable assignment, null variable value is the 
same that of 0 in other cases.  
  When #2=<Null> , #1=#2,    #1=<Null>； 
             #1=#2*3,    #1=0;  
                    #1=#2+#2,   #1=0; 
       Beside using the Null to assign, the variable value is 0 in other conditions.  


Chapter 2  G Codes 
111 
I  Programming 
  When #2=< Null >, #1=#2,    #1=<Null>； 
             #1=#2·3,    #1=0;  
                    #1=#2+#2,   #1=0; 
<Null> in conditional expression is different with 0.  
   When #2=<Null>, #2 EQ #0，#2 NE 0, the condition is false.  
    When #2=0, #2 EQ #0，#2 NE 0, the condition is false. 
 
（2）Variable Type 
The variable is divided into the different variable types according to the variable number, 
their use and prosperity are different below: 
Table 2-26-1 
Variable range
Variable type 
Function 
#0 
Null variable 
The variable is null and is not assigned.  
#1～#33 
Local variable
The local variable is used to transmit parameters 
(when the system uses G65, G66 to call 
subprograms every time, it initializes the local 
variable value by parameters), and store data (for 
example: store operation result) in the macro 
program. When the system is turned off, the local 
variable is initialized to be null. When the macro 
program is called, the argument assigns to the 
local.  
#100～#199 
#500～#999 
Share variable
The share variable has the same meaning in the 
different macro program. When the system is 
turned off, the variable #100~#199 is initialized to 
be null, #500~#999 is saved and is not lost.  
#1000-- 
System variable The system variable is used to read all types of 
data when CNC runs.  
 
（3）Variable range 
The input range of the local variable and common variable is -99999999~99999999 which 
integer part and decimal part are up to 8-digit number. When the assignment exceeds the valid 
range, an alarm occurs. When the operation result exceeds -99999999~99999999 and is stored 
into the variable, the system window displays “***” which means overflow. When the variable is 
used in code, the relevant operation result is displayed to “***”; when the digit exceeds 8-digit, its 
former 8 digits are valid, and its ninth digit is rounded; the middle result in the macro variable 
count can be more than the valid input digital. 
 
Note 1: The variable cannot be referred to address O and N. The system cannot use O#200，N#220 to execute the 
programming;  
Note 2: When the variable exceeds the max. code value defined by the address, it cannot be used; for example: #230 
= 120: M#230 exceeds the max. code value; 
Note 3: The system cannot identify –0 and + 0. # 4 = - 0: X # 4 is taken as X 0; 
Note 4: When the variable is used to the address data, the other except for the valid digit is rounded.  
Note 5: The number followed by the address can use <Formular> to replace. The system takes “Word address 
[<Formular>]” or word address-[<Formular>]” as a program, and take <Formular> value or its negative value

112 
 
I  Programming 
 
as the code value of the address.  
Note 6: The decimal point which defines the variable in a program can be omitted. For example, #1=123 is defined, the 
actual value of #1 is 123.000;   
Note 7: The negative sign of variable value which changes the reference should be placed in the front of #, such as 
G00X-#1; 
Note 8:The variable #1～#33, #100～#199 are cleared out after they reset, which are set by NO.6001Bit7（CLV） and 
Bit6（CCV）, and which cannot be executed in MDI mode; 
Note 9: When the variable value overflows, the code address referring to the variable is ignored.  
Note 10: NO.6000 Bit5（SBM）sets whether the single block stop is valid in user macro program.  
Note 11: The number in expression (including brackets) can be omitted. For example, X[10] actual value is 
X10.000. 
2.24.2  System Variable 
The system variable is used to read and write NC internal data. For example, some system 
variable only read the tool offset value and current position data. The system variable is the base 
of the automatic control and general machining program development. 
 
（1）Interface signal 
The interface signal can program the exchange message between the machine controller 
and user macro programs, i.e. it completes the exchange with PLC by G, F signals and the 
interfaces with IO are defined by PLC. 
The input signal can be only read, and the output signal can be read and written.

（2）Tool compensation value 
The system variable can read/write the tool compensation value. The system variable of the 
tool compensation storage area is 2001～2999. The variable numbers divided exactly by 100 in 
the above range are illegal. The concrete ranges are referred to the following table. 
Table 2-26-2 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
（3）Marco program alarm 
Alarms and alarm messages specified by the user can exist in programs. The variable can only 
be written instead of being read. 
Variable 
Function 
#3000 
When the system executes the assignment statement of #3000=XXX, 
it stops the run and alarms. 
The alarm message only displays 31 characters (15 Chinese 
characters), and the system only displays the first 31 characters when 
there are more than it.  
The value of the alarm number being #3000 adds 3000, the alarm 
range is 3000 to 3200.  
When #3000 value is less than 0, the alarm number is 3000, when 
#3000 value is more than 200, the alarm number is 3200. 
 
Example:  
#3000=6; the tool has not found 
When the system executes the block, it stops and alarms and the alarm number is 3006. 
The alarm message is “TOOL NOT FOUND”, The system maybe alarm in advance because of 
the buffer exists. 
The alarm message can use the small brackets. For example, #3000=6(TOOL NOT 
FOUND). When the small brackets and the semicolon are in the block, the latter specified 
message is valid, such as #3000=6(TOOL NOT FOUND); TOOL NOT FOUND，the displayed 
message is “TOOL NOT FOUND”.

run and displays only one prompt message. 
The alarm message only displays 26 characters (13 Chinese characters), 
and the system only displays the first 26 characters when there are more than 
it. The value of the alarm number being #3006 adds 3200, the prompt number 
range is 3201 to 3500. When #3006 value is less than 1, the alarm number is 
3201, when #3006 value is more than 300, the alarm number is 3500. 
For example:  
#3006=3; wait for run  
When the system executes the block, it stops and displays one prompt and the prompt 
number is 3203. The prompt message is “WAITING FOR RUN”. The format of the prompt 
message is the same that of description in the macro program alarm.

The system variable is the state value of the system, and is buffered in advance when multi cycles are 
executed, so, the attained system variable is the value before the multi cycle command instead of the current 
value to avoid using the system variable in the cycle body of the multi cycles.

（2）EXP function input value cannot be more than 80, otherwise, an alarm occurs;  
（3）”/” character in <expression>(in the right of assignment”=” or in the bracket []) is taken 
as the division operator instead of optional block skip code;  
(4) A bracket “[]” is used to 5 levels, including the bracket used in the function. An alarm 
occurs when it exceeds 5 levels.  
（5）The angle units of the triangle function SIN, COS, ASIN, ACOS, TAN and ATAN are 
degrees, for example: 90°30＇is 90.5 degree; 
（6）#i=ASIN[#j] value range:  
   When NO.6004 No. 0-digit NAT is set to 0: 90°～270° 
      When NO.6004 No. 0-digit NAT is set to 1: -90°～90° 
          When #j exceeds between -1 and 1, the system alarms and #j can be a constant. 
（7）#i=ACOS[#j] range: 0°～180°。 
When #j exceeds between -1 and 1, the system alarms and #j can be a constant. 
（8）In #i= ATAN[#j]/[#k], ATAN #j and #k are the weight length of two right-angle sides as 
follows:  
When NO.6004 No. 0-digit NAT is set to 0: 0°～360° 


 GSK988MA/MB Series Milling Center CNC System Programming & Operation User Manual

I  Programming 
 
Example: when #1=ATAN[-1]/[-1] is specified, #1=225°. 
     When NO.6004 No. 0-digit NAT is set to 1: -180°～180° 
Example: when #1=ATAN[-1]/[-1] is specified,#1=-135° 
      #j，#K can be the constant. 
In division or TAN[90], the division is specified to 0, P/S alarms;   
（9）The function ROUND is used to NC code or macro statement, which rounds the data 
with the decimal point. It is used to NC statement, which rounds according to the least 
setting unit; when it is used to the macro statement, which rounds No. 1-digit decimal 
point; 
     In executing #2=ROUND[#3], when #3=1.2345, the variable #2 value is 1. 
In ISB increment metric input, #2=1.2345, #3=2.5456: 
      G00 X#2； the tool moves to 1.234mm 
      G00 X#3； the tool moves to 2.545mm 
（10）For FUP, FIX, when the absolute value of the integer after execution is more than that 
of the original, it is FUP; when it is less than that, it is FIX.  
When #2=1.2，#3=-1.2 
      In executing #4=FUP[#2], 2.0 is assigned to #4 
      In executing #4=FIX[#2], 1.0 is assigned to #4 
In executing #4=FUP[#3], -2.0 is assigned to #4 
      In executing #4=FUP[#3], -1.0 is assigned to #4 
（11）Logic operation OR, XOR, AND firstly are conversed the decimal into the binary, and 
are executed in the binary by one-digit to one digit.  
      Range: 0～99999999，when it has the decimal point, it is ignored.  
      Example:  
#101=10  （the binary is: 00001010） 
      #102=12  （the binary is: 00001100） 
      #103=#101 OR #102   （or the operation result is : 00001110） 
The window display result of macro variable is #101=10.000000 #102=12.000000 #  
103=14.000000 
（12）The function BIN converses the decimal into the binary which is displayed in decimal 
system.  
      The function converses the binary number displayed in decimal system into 8421 
format BCD. The system cannot display and alarms when some digit in BCD code 
after conversion exceeds 9.  
      
   Example 1：      
#101=37        （BCD 37 corresponds to the binary : 00110111） 
      #102=BCD[#101] 
Macro variable window display #102=55.000000 
 
(2) Transfer and cycle codes  
The transfer and the repetition codes can change the control flow, and there are three kind of 
transfer and repetition operation: the unconditional transfer GOTO, the conditional transfer 
IF…GOTO, IF…THEN and WHILE DO repetition. 
Command format:  


Chapter 2  G Codes 
119 
I  Programming 
GOTO n; 
Command function:  
Skip to the line number n without condition;  
Command format:  
IF <Logical expression> THEN <expression>; 
Command function: 
When the logical expression is valid, the system executes one following THEN, otherwise, it 
executes the next block.  
Command format:  
IF < Logical expression > GOTOn; 
Command function: 
When the logical expression is valid, the system skips the block with the line number n to 
execute, otherwise, it executes the next block;  
Command format:  
WHILE < Logical expression >  DOn; 
…………； 
ENDn 
Command function: 
When the logical expression is valid, the system executes the block between Do and END, 
otherwise, its execute the block following END. The numerical value n following DO and END 
is used to specify the execute range label of the specified program, n value is 1, 2, 3. The 
system alarms when n is not 1, 2, 3. 
IF, WHILE logical operation character rules are as follows:  
Operator    substitute  character definition  
EQ    
    ==        （=） 
NE    
    <>        （≠） 
GT    
    >         （＞） 
GE         
>=        （≥） 
LT         
<         （＜） 
LE         
<=        （≤） 
Note 1: When the system transfers to the block with the serial number n and specifies the another exceeding the serial 
number range between 1 and 99999, P/S alarms, and the expression can specify the serial number; 
Note 2: The conditional expression must include the operator which is inserted in the middle of two variables or the 
variable and the constant and is closed by the bracket[]. The expression can be replaced by the variable; 
Note 3: The number following D0 and the one following END specify the execution range label of the specified 
program, and the label value is 1, 2, 3. The system alarms when n is not 1, 2, 3;   
Note 4: The label (1-3) in the repetition DO—END can be used many times, but P/S alarms when there is the cross 
repetition (superposition in DO range); 
Note 5: When the system specifies D0 instead of WHILE statement, it creates the limitless repetition between DO and 
END;  
Note 6: In using EQ, NE logical operation expression, <Null> and zero have the different result. <Null> is taken as the 
zero in +, -, * conditional expression;  
Note 7: The macro program statement cannot be used with NC statement together, and the macro program statement 
definition is as follows:  
       Block including arithmetic or logical operation(=);  
Block including the control statement (such as TOTO, DO, END);  
Block including macro program call code (such as G65, G66, G67 or other G codes, M code call macro 
program) ;

Any blocks except for macro program statements are NC statements;  
Note 8: Any blocks except for macro program states are NC statements.  
Note 9: The system can use the substitution character which is easily understood to replace the operator. ‘>’, ‘<’ can be 
edit in PC instead of on MDI keyboard and are uploaded into the system; 
Note 10: When macro statement needs a line number, the line number must be compiled in the front the statement; 
Note 11: In MDI mode, the system cannot execute the skip statement, otherwise, it alarms.  
 
Example:  
（1）GOTO example 
 
（2）IF <Logical expression> THEN <expression> example 
     IF[#2 EQ #3] THEN #4=0； 
     When #2 value is same that of #3, #4 value is 0. 
（3）WHILE <Logical expression>  DOn;…；ENDn example 
  
 
2.24.4  Macro Program Statement and NC Statement 
The following blocks are macro program statements:  
Including arithmetic or logical operation (=);  
Including control statement(such as GOTO, DO, END);  
Including macro program call code (G65, G66, G67).  
Any NC blocks except for macro program statement are NC statements.  
In Single Block mode, when No.6000 Bit5 (SBM) is set to 0, the system directly skips the macro 
program statement and the machine does not stop, but it is set to 1, the system stops run and 
enters the stop state.  
One block cannot have the macro program statement and NC statement simultaneously. 
2.24.5  Macro Program Call 
（1）Non-modal call of macro program G65 
Command format: G65  P    L __  〈argument list 〉； 
Command function: The system calls macro program L times specified by P and transfers the 
argument to the called macro program. 
Command explanations: P: specify the macro program to be called; 
L: times of calling the macro program, and its default is 1 and its 
range is 1～9999; 
Argument list: data transferred to macro programs. 
Argument specification： 
Two types of argument specification are available. Argument specification I uses letters other than 
G, L, O, N and P once each. Argument specification II uses A, B and C once each and also uses Ii,

Addresses that need not be specified can be omitted and local variables corresponding to an 
omitted address are set to null; 
Addresses do not need to be specified alphabetically. They conform to word address format, but 
I, J , K are specified according to the letter order;  
Example: B_A_D_…J_K_ Correct 
B_A_D_…K_J_ Incorrect

Note 1: G65 must be specified before any argument; 
Note 2: After G65, specify at address P and L. when P or L is repeated and No.3403 Bit6 (AD2) is set 0, the 
specification later takes precedence, otherwise, the system alarms; 
Note 3: Subscripts of I, J, K in the argument specification II for indicating the order of argument specification are not 
written in the actual program;  
Note 4: The CNC internally identifies argument specification I and argument specification II. If a mixture of argument 
specification I and argument specification II is specified, the type of argument specification specified later 
takes precedence; 
Note 5: Calls can be nested to a depth of four levels including simple calls G65 and modal calls G66. This does not 
include subprogram call M98.

I  Programming 
 
Note 6: Whether the units used for argument without a decimal point correspond to the least input increment of each 
address is related to the parameter DPI (No.3401#0); 
Note 7: G65, G66 cannot be in the same block with NC code, otherwise, the system alarms; 
Note 8: In macro program nesting call, the local variables from level 0 to 4 are provided for nesting. When the level of 
the main program is 0, each time a macro is call, the local variable level is incremented by one. The values of 
the local variables at the previous level are saved in the CNC. When M99 is executed in a macro program, 
control returns to the calling program. At that time, the values of the local variables saved when the macro was 
called are restored.  
Note 9: The line number of the code line of the macro statement must be home, otherwise, the system alarms.

                   ……； 
                       G67； 
Command explanation: 
G66：modal macro program call needs one line to be specified;  
G67：call macro program call mode;  
P：specify many called macro programs;  
L：times for calling the macro program. It is default to 1, its range is 1—9999; 
Argument list: data sending to macro program is referred to the explanations of G65. 
 
Note 1: In G66, call a movement code in the same CNC file or M98, G65 or G66 cannot be executed in 
non-movement blocks; 
Note 2: G66 is specified before P_, L_ and argument, and the use methods of P, L, the argument are the same 
those of G65; 
Note 3: G66 can’t call a macro program in G66 blocks but it can execute the call only when its mode is called; 
without movement codes, it cannot call a macro pgoram in miscellaneous function or dry run mode; 
Note 4: The local variable (argument) is specified only in G66 block, and the system does not set it again when 
each modal call is executed; 
Note 5: Cannot specify the macro call code in MDI mode;

Chapter 3  MSTF Codes 
3.1  M Codes (Miscellaneous Function) 
M code consists of code address M and its following digits (the digit is set by No.3030), used for 
controlling the flow of executed program or outputting M codes to PLC . 
 
There is one valid M code in one block. There are most specified 3 M codes in one block(set by 
NO.3404 Bit 7 (M3B) ). The corresponding relationship between M codes and their functions are 
determined by the machine manufacturer. CNC sends M code signal and one strobe signal to PLC in 
executing M codes.  
Except for M00、M01、M02、M30、M98、M198、M99, all M codes are executed in PLC. Their 
functions, meanings, control sequence and logic are referred to the machine manufacture’s manual 
books. 
3.1.1  End of Program M02 
Command format:  M02 or M2     
Command function: In Auto mode, after M02 is executed and other codes of current block are 
executed, the automatic run stops. Whether the cursor returns the home of 
program is set by No.3404 Bit5 (M02). The cursor must return to the start of 
program when the program is executed again. 
Except for the above-mentioned function executed by NC, M02 function is also defined by PLC 
ladder diagram as follows: current output of CNC is reserved after M02 is executed.  
3.1.2  End of Program Run M30 
Command format:  M30 
Command function: In Auto mode, after other codes of current block are executed in M30, the 
automatic run stops, the amount of workpiece is added 1, the tool nose radius 
compensation is cancelled and the cursor returns to the start of program 
(whether the cursor return to the start of program or not is defined by 
parameters). 
Besides the above-mentioned function executed by NC, M30 function is also defined by PLC ladder 
diagram as follows: the system closes M03, M04 or M08 signal output and outputs M05 signal after M30 
is executed. 
3.1.3  Program Stop M00 
Command format: M00 or M0 
Command function: the system stops the automatic run after M00 block is executed, which is same 
that of the single block pausing to save the previous modal message, i.e. which 
is equal to the program pause function. Press the CYCLE START key on the 
operation panel to execute the follow block and the CNC continuously 
automatically runs.  
When M00 are other G code are in the same block, the system executes the code in the block, then 
M00, and last stops running.

3.1.4  Optional Stop M01 
Command format: M01 or M1 
Command function: after the block containing M01 is executed, the system stops the automatic run 
and the single block stopping signal lights. M01 is valid when the OPTIONAL STOP on the 
machine operation panel is pressed. 
3.1.5  Subprogram Call  M98 
Command format：M98  P○○○○□□□□ 
 
 
 
 
 
Command function: In Auto mode, after other codes in the current block are executed in M98, CNC 
calls subprograms specified by P. 
When the subprogram is called one time, ○○○○ can be omitted in inputting the number“○○○○□□□□” 
behind P, at the same time, the leading zero of the called subprogram number can be omitted and 
the system does not alarms. Example: M98 P12; it expresses to call the subprogram O0012 one 
time; the leading zero cannot be omitted when the subprogram call times are more than one.  
The called subprogram name in M98 must be the program in the system and be less than 9999, and 
the subprogram name must be input.   
The specified call times in M98 is 1～9999.  
The called subprogram format in M98 is the following. The last end of the subprogram must be M99 
instead of M30, its program compiling format is the same that of the main program compiling format.  
Subprogram： O□□□□；（subprogram name）

Fig.3-1-1 subprogram call 
The called subprogram can call other subprograms. The subprogram called by the main program 
is called as the one-embedded subprogram, and the one called by the one-embedded subprogram is 
called as the two-embedded subprogram and so forth. One main program can call 12-embedded 
subprogram (including macro program call). The following is the four-embedded subprogram.

Command format： M99  P○○○○○ 
 
 
 
Command function: After other codes of current block in the subprogram are executed, the system 
returns to the main program and continues to execute next block specified by P, 
and calls a block following M98 of current subprogram when P is not input. The 
current program is executed repeatedly when M99 is defined to end of program 
(namely, the current program is executed without calling other programs).  
Example:   Execution path of calling subprogram (with P in M99) as Fig. 3-1-3.Execution path of calling subprogram 
(without P in M99) as Fig. 3-1-4.

Note 1: M99 does not need to be specified in the alone block. Example: G00 X100 Z100 M99;  
Note 2: An alarm occurs when M99 has codeed the block number which does not exist;  
Note 3: In Auto mode, the specified block number following M99 is repetitive, and the system executes the followings: 1. 
when the two block numbers are front of M98 block, the program returns to the later repetitive block; 2. when the 
two block numbers are behind of M98 block, the program returns to the top repetitive block; 3. when the two block 
numbers are separately in front of or behind of M98 block, the program returns to the later repetitive block;  
Note 4: In Auto mode, the system ignores the line and returns to the beginning of the file to perform the execution 
when the main program ends in M99 and specifies the line number following P。 
3.1.8  Notes for M Codes 
1．M00, M01, M02, M30, M98, M99 is separately specified in one block. When it with other M code 
are specified, the system ignores the other M code and the above M code is executed; when the 
above seven M codes are in the same block, the first codeed M code is valid.  
2．When M05, M11, M13, M33, M9 and G codes are in the same block, there are two execution 
methods: 
       a) The motion codes and M miscellaneous function codes are executed simultaneously. 
   b) The miscellaneous function codes following the motion codes are executed. 
Refer to the tool manufacturer’s user manual. The second method is executed for GSK’s 
standard ladder. 
3．CNC permits there are up to specified 3 codes in one block (when NO.3404 Bit7 M3B is set to 1), 
some M codes cannot be specified simultaneously because of machinery operation, such as the 
spindle’s automatic gear change codes: M41, M42, M43, M44. 
4．No.3010 sets the delay time of the strobe signal MF, SF, TF signals. 


Chapter 3  MSTF Codes

5．No.3011 sets the width of M, S, T function end signals (FIN). 
3.2  Spindle Function 
S code is used to controlling spindle speed. In GSK988MA/MB spindle speed control, NC outputs 
0~10V analog voltage signal to spindle servo device or inverter to realize the gradeless spindle speed. 
3.2.1  Spindle Speed Analog Voltage Control 
Command format: S □□□□□ 
 
 
 
 
 
Command function: the spindle speed is defined, and the system outputs 0～10V analog voltage to 
control spindle servo or converter to realize the stepless timing. S code value is 
not reserved, and it is 0 after the system is switched on. 
Command explanation: spindle speed analog voltage control code  
□□□□□ means the set spindle speed, its value range is referred to Table 1-4, 
and the leading zero can be omitted. When the value exceeds the range set 
by No.3772, the most spindle speed limit is specified in the program, and S 
value is specified to the most spindle speed; when it is not specified, the 
upper and lower limit of S value is specified. The system alarms when the 
decimal is input to the specified of the S value. The system can set the digit 
number by No.3031.  
The first spindle of the CNC can execute 4-gear spindle speed, and the second spindle has 2-gear 
spindle speed. In executing S code, the system counts the analog voltage value corresponding to 
the specified speed according to setting value(corresponding to No.3741～No.3744) of max. spindle 
speed (analog voltage is 10V)of current gear, and then outputs to spindle servo or converter to 
ensure that the spindle actual speed and the requirement are the same. 
After the CNC is switched on, the analog output voltage is 0V. The analog output voltage is reserved 
(except that the system is in cutting feed in the surface speed control mode and the absolute value 
of X absolute coordinates is changed) after S code is executed. The analog output voltage is 0V 
after S0 is executed. The analog output voltage is reserved when the system resets and emergently 
stops. 
When the spindle speed analog voltage control is valid, there are 2 methods to input the spindle 
speed: the spindle fixed speed is defined by S code( r/min), and is invariant without changing S code 
value, which is called constant speed control(G97 modal); other is the tangent speed of tool relative to 
the outer circle of workpiece defined by S code, which is called constant surface speed control (G96 
modal), and the spindle speed is changed along with the absolute coordinates value of X absolute 
coordinates in programming path when cutting feed is executed in the constant surface speed. 
 
3.2.2  Spindle Override 
When the spindle speed analog voltage control is valid, the spindle actual speed can be tuned real 
time by the spindle override and is limited by max spindle speed of current gear after the spindle 
override is tuned, and it also limited by limited values of max. and min. spindle speed in constant 
surface speed control mode. 
The system supplies 8 steps for spindle override (50%～120% increment of 10%). The actual 
steps and tune of spindle override are defined by PLC ladder and introductions from machine 
manufacturer should be referred when using it. Refer to the following functions of GSK988MA/MB 
standard PLC ladder. 
The spindle actual speed specified by GSK988MA/MB standard PLC ladder can be tuned real time

by the spindle override tune key at 8 steps in 50%～120% and it is not reserved when the spindle 
override is switched off. Refer to the operations of spindle override in Ⅱ OPERATION.

Chapter 4  Cutter Compensation 
4.1  Application for Cutter Radius Compensation 
4.1.1  Brief 
Generally, the parts machining process is programmed according to parts drawing in one point on a 
tool. As for the tool used actually, because of the processing or other requirement, the tool is not an ideal 
point, but an arc only. The position offset exists between actual cutting point and ideal point when the 
cutting feed is performed. It may cause over cut or undercut, so the part accuracy will be affected. So, 
the cutter radius compensation can be used to improve the part accuracy in machining. 
The path of part figure can be shifted by a cutter radius, which this method is called B type tool 
compensation; this is a simply method but the movement path of next block can be processed only after 
a block is performed, so the phenomenon as over cutting will be generated at the intersection point of 
two blocks. 
In order to settle the above issues and eliminate the error, the Tool compensation C should be 
setup. When a block is read in, the tool compensation C is not performed immediately but the next block 
is read in again. Corresponding movement path is calculated according to the point of intersection of two 
blocks (conjunction vector). The tool compensation C performs more accurate compensation in figure 
because two blocks are read for processing in advance. See the Fig. 6-1. 
 
4.1.2  Compensation value setting 
The radius value of each tool should be set before tool compensation C is applied. Tool radius 
compensation value is set in the OFFSET page (table 6-1), this page contains tool geometric radius and 
tool radius wear. There into, D is the tool compensation value, when the bit 1 of bit parameter No.002 is 
1, the D is compensation value input by diameter. If the bit 1 of bit parameter No.002 is 0, the D is 
compensation value input by radius. The following explanations are all indicated in radius compensation 
value if not especially pointed out.

4.1.5  Caution 
 
In initial status CNC is in cutter radius compensation cancellation mode. CNC sets cutter radius 
compensation offset mode when the G41 or G42 command is executed. At the beginning of the 
compensation, the CNC reads two blocks in advance, the next block is stored in the cutter radius 
compensation buffer memory when a block is performed. When in Single mode, two blocks are read, 
after the end point of the 1st block is performed, it is stopped. Two blocks are read in advance in 
successive performance. So, there are a block being performed and two blocks behind it in CNC. 
 
The cutter radius compensation value can not be a negative, normally, the wearing value is negative 
(negative value indicates for wearing) 
 
Instead of G02 or G03, the setting or cancellation of cutter radius compensation can be commanded 
only by using G00 or G01, or the alarm occurs. 
 
CNC will cancel Tool compensation C mode when you press RESET key. 
 
Corresponding offset should be specified while the G40, G41 or G42 is specified in the block, or the 
alarm occurs. 
 
When cutter radius compensation is employed in main program and subprogram, the CNC should 
cancel compensation mode before calling or exiting sub-program (namely, before M98 or M99 is 
performed), or the alarm occurs. 
 
Cancel the compensation mode temporarily when G54-59, G28-31 and canned cycle command are 
executed. Restore the cutter radius compensation mode when the above commands are finished. 
 
4.1.6  Example for application 
The parts are machined in the coordinate system in Fig. 6-3. The tool compensation number D07 is 
employed, tool geometric radius is 2mm and the tool radius wearing is 0.

4.2  Offset Path Explanation for Cutter Radius Compensation 
4.2.1  Conception for inner side or outer side 
“Inner side” and “outer side” will be employed in the following explanations. When an angle of 
intersection created by tool paths specified by move commands for two blocks is over or equal to 180°, it 
is referred to as “inner side”. When the angle is between 0° and 180°, it is referred to as “outer side”.

4.2.4  Tool operation in offset cancellation mode 
When the G40 command is employed in block in compensation mode, the CNC enters the 
compensation cancellation mode. This is called compensation cancellation. 
The circular arc command (G02 and G03) can not be employed when the cutter radius 
compensation C is cancelled. If they are commanded, alarm is generated and the operation is stopped 
It controls and performs this block and the blocks in the cutter radius compensation buffer memory 
in the compensation cancellation mode. If the single block switch is turned on, it stops after executing a 
block. The next block is executed instead of reading it when the start key is pressed again

4.2.5  Interference check 
Tool over cutting is called “interference”. The interference check function can check tool over cutting 
in advance. This interference check is performed even if the over cutting does not occur. However, all 
interference can not be checked by this function. 
 (1) Conditions for the interference 
1) The direction of the tool path is different from that of the programmed path. (90 degrees to 270 
degrees between these paths) 
2) In addition to the condition above, the angle between the start point and end point of the tool 
center path is quite different from that between the start point and end point of the programmed 
path in circular machining (more than 180 degrees). 
Example: Linear machining

(3) Automatic interference vector clear 
The system has the automatic interference vector clear function. For example, when the neighbor 
three blocks N10, N20, N30 execute the tool radius compensation, the section between N10 and 
N20 creates the vector V1, V2, V3 and V4, and the section between N20 and N30 creates V5, V6, 
V7, V8.  The system executes the interference check to the last vectors in the above two group of 
vector, i.e. V4 and V5. V4 and V5 are ignored when there is the interference; the system checks V3 
and V6, and they are ignored when there is the interference; the system does V2 and V7, and they 
are ignored when there is the interference. When the system executes the interference check to the 
last vectors V1 and V8, and there is the interference, they cannot be ignored, the tool stops 
movement and the system alarms. Based on the above process, the system executes the 
interference check, and has checked the vector which is not interfered, the followings are not check, 
and the tool runs according to the path of the first group vector which does not create the 
interference. When the last group of vector creates the vector, they cannot be ignored, the tool stops 
movement and No.257 alarms.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Note 1: NO.5008 Bit 0（CNI）can set whether the interference check is executed in tool nose radius compensation 
mode.  
Note 2: NO.5008 Bit 1（CNC）can set whether the system alarms when the difference 90°-270° between the 
movement direction and offset direction.  
Note 3: NO.5008 Bit 3（CNV）can set whether the system executes the interference check and the vector clear. 
 
4.2.6  Command of compensation vector cancel temporarily 
If the following commands G92, G28, G29, coordinate command selection G54~G59 and canned 
cycle are specified in compensation mode, the compensation vector is temporarily cancelled and then 
automatically restored after these commands are executed. Now, the temporary compensation vector 
cancellation is different to the compensation cancellation mode, tool is moved to the specified point by 
compensation vector cancellation from the intersection. And the tool moves to the intersection directly 
when the compensation mode restores.

 When the inner corner machining is less than tool radius 
When the inner corner machining is less than tool radius, the inner offset of a tool will cause over cut. 


 Chapter 4  Cutter Compensation

I  Programmin 
The tool stops and alarm occurs after moving at the beginning or at the corner in previous block. But if 
the switch of “Single block” is ON, the tool will be stopped at the end of the previous block. 
 
 When a groove less than the tool diameter is machined 
When the tool center moves opposite to the direction of programmed path, the over cutting will be 
generated by the cutter radius compensation. Tool stops and alarm appears after moving at the 
beginning of previous block or at the corner. 
 
 When a step less than the tool radius is machined 
When a program contains a step which is an arc and less than tool radius, tool center path may form 
a opposite movement direction to the programmed path. So the first vector is ignored and it moves to the 
end of the second vector along a straight line. The program will be stopped for Single block mode, the 
cycle continues if it is not single block mode. The compensation will be executed correctly and no alarm 
will be generated if the step is a straight line. (But the uncut part is reserved.) 
 When the sub-program is contained in G code 
CNC should be in compensation cancellation mode before calling the sub-program (namely, before 
the G98 is performed). Offset can be applied after entering the sub-program, but the compensation 
cancellation should be applied before returning to the main-program (before M99), or the alarm occurs. 
 When compensation value is changed 
(a) Usually, the compensation value is changed when the tool change is performed in compensation 
cancellation mode. If the compensation value is changed in compensation mode, the new one is 
ineffective which is effective till the program is executed again. 
(b) If different compensation values are commanded in different blocks of a program, different 
compensation value will be compensated to the corresponding block. But if it is an arc, the alarm will be 
generated. For details, refer to the following explanation. 
(c) about “arc data error in C type cutter radius compensation”. 
 When the end point for the programming arc is not on the arc 
When the end point for the programming arc is not on the arc, the tool stops and the alarm 
information shows “end point is not on the arc”.

The “last two same points” may occur when starting at the last program, in the case of the 
compensation has been performed. The section without moving which is regarded as the movement 
approximates to the zero, so it is necessary to maintain the compensation amount. The transit point 
between N1 and N2 is P1, and the transit point between N2 and N3 is P2, P1 and P2 are shared a same 
point. 
In the same way, in the compensation mode, if the “two same points” may occur, the compensation 
value will be maintained; in the retraction mode, the similar start mode is divided into “the previous two 
same points” and “the last two same points”

The path after N9 block  is not inserted 
 
After a block (N9 G91 G0 X0 Y0) (without moving) is inserted between N1 and N2 in the 
above-mentioned program, the “circular data error in cutter compensation C” may alarm. 
Because the point after N9 inserted which is equal to the one of N1, namely, they are regarded as 
“two same points”. The transit point P1 is performed treating the “two same points”, the position of P1 is 
obviously differ from the above one which does not insert the N9 block. So the cut circular arc path by 
this transit point is absolutely differing from the path to be machined, so the alarm is then generated: 
“circular arc data error in cutter compensation C”

The P1 and P2 are the transit point of tool compensation as the left figure shown, wherein the “r” is 
compensation radius. This is a normal treatment mode for the straight line to circular arc. 
 
 
The alarm may occur in terms of the following program 
 
N0 G90 G00 X0 Y0 Z0 
 
N1 G01 G41 X0 Y0 D1 F800 …without moving originally start 
,    N2 G02 X50 R25 
 
 
Because the N1 block does not a movement, namely, it equals to the “two same points”. The transit 
points P1 and P2 are performed based on the treatment of two same points (The path of two same

points), so the circular arc path cut by this transit point obviously differs from the actual path to be 
machined, in this case, the “circular arc data error in cutter compensation C” may alarm.

II Operation 
1.2  Setting the System  
The operator can set CNC by CNC host machine buttons and the normal setting is: the tool offset 
setting, CNC setting and the macro variable setting.  
 
Tool offset setting: The tool has its own dimension (length, diameter). When the workpiece with 
certain shape is machined, the tool dimensions vary based on the different movement amounts. 
If the dimension data of the tools are set in advance, the tool path is automatically given by the 
same program even the different tools are used, so the workpiece shape specified by the 
program can be cut by any tool.  
The data of the tool dimension are called as the offset amount (Refer to Chapter Seven for details.).  
 
CNC setting: CNC setting includes setting the system, the coordinate, the system time and the 
system IP. (About the details, refer to Chapter 3.4.).  
 
Macro variable setting: CNC system can support the various macro editing, while the variable 
required by the macro should be set here.

II Operation 
Chapter 2  Power on/off and Safety Protection  
2.1  Power-on  
Before GSK988MA power on, please confirm: 
4、 CNC and the machine are normal in the appearance;  
5、 The power supply voltage complies to the requirements of the manufacturer;  
6、 The connection is correct and firm.  
After GSK988MA is powered on, the page is shown as Fig. 2-1:  
 
Fig. 2-1 
Then, GSK988MA should be self-checked and initialized. After self-checking and initializing, the 
page is displayed the current position (dual-channel), which is shown as Fig. 2-2:  
 
 
Fig.2-2 
 
2.2  Power-off  
Please confirm before power-off:  
1. All movable parts of the machine should be stopped;  
2. The miscellaneous function (such as the spindle, the water pump) is off;  
3. CNC power supply should be cut off firstly, and then the machine power supply is cut off.  


 GSK988MA/MB Series Milling Center CNC System Programming & Operation User Manual 
 
166
II Operation 
Note: 1. Turn on the power, again after power off for 20 seconds.  
2. About the operation of cutting the machine power supply, please refer to the user  manual from the machine 
manufacturer.  
 
2.3  Overtravel Protection  
To avoid the machine damage due to the each axis overtravel, the machine must be adopted the 
overtravel protection measures.  
The limit switches should be respectively installed on the maximum stroke position in the positive 
and negative directions of each axis on the machine. When the overtravel occurs, the limit switch is 
operated, the system decelerates till stops, and the overtravel alarm occurs.   
    During automatic running, when one axis is touched the limit switch, all axes along which the tools 
are being moved should be decelerated and stopped, and the overtravel alarm occurs.  
During manual operation, just the axis in which the tool touching the limit switch is decelerated and 
stopped, the tool is still moved along other axis.  
The method of clearing “the overtravel” is: In manual mode, the worktable is moved reversely (like 
the positive overtravel, it is moved negatively, vise versa), and moved away from the limit switch. The 
system resets and issues the alarm.  
Note: The method of the releasing the machine overtravel is different with that introduced in the manual; about the 
detailed operation, please refer to the user manual of the machine manufacturer.  
2.4  Overtravel Protection of Stored Stroke 
GSK988MA system provides three stored stroke check areas: The areas in which the tools can’t 
enter can be specified as the stored stroke check 1, the stored stroke check 2 and the stored stroke 
check 3, which is shown as Fig. 2-3:  
 
Fig.2-3 
When the tool exceeds a stored stroke limit, an alarm is displayed and the tool is decelerated and 
stopped. When the tool enters a forbidden area and an alarm is generated, the tool can be moved in the 
reverse direction from which the tool comes.  
 
Stored stroke check 1: Parameters (Nos. 1320, 1321 or Nos. 1326, 1327) set the boundary. Outside 
the area of the set limits is a forbidden area. The machine builder sets this area as the maximum stroke.  


Chapter 2  Power on/off and Safety Protection 
 
167
II Operation 
Stored stroke check 2 (G22 G23): Parameters (Nos. 1322, 1323 ) or commands set the boundaries. 
In case of programming, a G22 command forbids the tool to enter the forbidden area, and a G23 
command permits the tool to enter the forbidden area. Each of G22 and G23 should be commanded 
independently of another commands in a block. About the details, refer to G commands introduction.  
 
Stored stroke check 3: Set the boundary with parameters No.1324 and 1325. The area inside the 
boundary becomes the forbidden area.  
 
Forbidden area overlapping: Area can be set in piles (refer to the following Fig. 2-4). Unnecessary 
limits should be set beyond the machine stroke.   
 
 
Fig. 2-4 
Effective time for a forbidden area: Each limit becomes effective after the power is turned on and 
manual reference position return or automatic reference position return by G28 has been performed. 
After the power is turned on, if the reference position is in the forbidden area of each limit, an alarm is 
generated immediately.  
Time for displaying an alarm: Parameter BFA (bit 7 of No. 1300) selects whether an alarm is 
displayed immediately before the tool enters the forbidden area or immediately after the tool has entered 
the forbidden area. The parameter is only valid to the stored stroke 1 rather than “the software limits 2 
and 3”.  
Releasing the alarms: When the tool has become unmovable in the forbidden area, the tool is 
moved reversely (like the positive overtravel, it is moved negatively, vise versa) out of the forbidden area 
in manual mode, and the reset key is pressed to clear the alarm; if the setting is wrong, correct it and 
perform the reference position return, again.  
Note:  
In setting a forbidden area, if the two points to be set are same, the area is as follows:   
1. When the forbidden area is stored stroke check 1, all areas are forbidden areas.  
2. When the forbidden area is stored stroke check 2 or stored stroke check 3, all areas are movable areas.  
3. When 1300.7=1 and the alarm occurs, the machine coordinate is outside the forbidden area, the alarm can be 
directly cancelled by pressing the resetting key.  
4. When 1300.7=0, and the alarm occurs, the machine coordinate is inside the forbidden area, the tool is moved 
outside of the alarm area, and then the alarm can be cancelled by pressing the resetting key. 
The software limit function is invalid when the stored stroke check 1 is set and the coordinate set value of the 
positive boundary is less than that of the negative boundary.  
2.5  Emergency Operation  
During machining, some unexpected consequence may occur due to the user programming, 
operation and the product fault, GSK988MA operation must stop immediately. In this chapter, the

II Operation 
measures are taken by GSK988MA in emergency; About the measures taken by the CNC machine tool, 
please refer to the user manual from the machine builder.  
2.5.1  Resetting  
When GSK988MA is abnormally output and the coordinate axis is abnormally operated, press 
 key to make GSK988MA in resetting status;  
1. All axis movement is decelerated and stopped;  
2. M and S function output is invalid;  
3. Automatic running stops and modal function remains.  
Note: After 
 is pressed, whether automatically switch off the signals of the spindle CW/CCW 
rotation, the lubrication and the cooling, etc. is set by the parameters.  
2.5.2  Emergency stop  
During the machine running, the emergency stop button (the external emergency stop signal is valid) 
is pressed in the dangerous or in the emergency situation, CNC takes the emergency stop measures, 
and the machine movement is stopped immediately, all output (such as the spindle revolution and the 
coolant, etc) are all switched off. The emergency stop alarm is released after releasing the emergency 
stop button, CNC enters the resetting status.  
 
Note 1: Please confirm the trouble has been removed before the emergency stop alarm is released;  
Note 2: The electric shock can be reduced when the emergency stop button is pressed before power-on/off.  
Note 3: After the emergency stop alarm is released, the reference position return should be executed, again to guarantee 
the correctness of the coordinate position.    
2.5.3  Feed hold  
During the machine running, the feeding can be hold after pressing 
 key. Please pay 
attention that the function can’t stop the feeding immediately during thread cutting and the cycle 
command executing.  
2.5.4  Cutting off the Power Supply  
During the machine running, in danger or in the emergency situation, the machine power supply 
must be cut off immediately to avoid the accident. Please pay attention that the reference position return 
should be executed, again if the coordinate displayed by CNC doesn’t comply with the actual position 
after power off.

compensation data input and power off in the set time, etc.  
|  Level 3: (The user) equipment management level includes rewriting the parameter, editing the part 
program and editing the tool compensation data, etc;  
Level 4: The machine operation level includes editing the tool compensation data and selecting the 
part program (that is to say: the tool setting can be operated the part program for automatic running can 
be selected), the parameters can’t be rewritten and the part program can’t be edited;  
|  Level 5: Operation limit level, without the operation password (the operation password cancel status), 
the parameters can’t be rewritten, the part program can’t be edit, the cutter compensation data can’t be 
edit, the part program can’t be selected (that is to say: the tool setting operation is invalid, only the

Chapter 5  Manual Operation 
5.1  Manual Reference Position Return 
A CNC machine tool is provided with a fixed position for setting the position of the machine 
worktable. And the fixed position is called as the reference position. Normally, tool change or setting the 
coordinate system is performed at this position. After power on, the tool is moved into the reference 
position. Manual reference position return is to move the tool into the reference position by the switches 
and the buttons on the operation panel. 
The three methods of setting GSK988MA reference position: zero return with the block, zero return 
without the block and zero return of the absolute encoder.  
 
Setting the reference position with the block  
When the parameter DLZx (the 1st bit of #1005) is 0, setting the reference position without the block 
is invalid (Setting the reference position with the block is valid), and the machine tool can return the 
reference position only after installing the deceleration switch.   
Detailed process: The tool is moved in the direction specified by the parameter ZMI (the 5th bit of 
#1006), the tool is moved to the deceleration point at the rapid traverse rate and returned to the 
reference position at FL speed. The reference position return finish lamp (LED) 
 
is ON, and the reference position return ends and the coordinate system is automatically set.   
 
Note: Each axis rapid traverse rate, the rapid movement override F0 speed and FL speed of reference position return 
is respectively set by the parameters (#1420, #1421 and #1425). 
 
 
Setting the reference position without the block 
When the parameter DLZx (the 1st bit of #1005) is 1, setting the reference position without the 
block is valid. The machine tool can return the reference position without installing the deceleration 
switch. 
Detailed process: After the machine tool is powered on each time, the reference position return is 
executed, the tool is moved in the direction specified by the parameter ZMI (the 5th bit of #1006). After 
the system detects the 1st PC signal of the motor, the reference position return finish lamp (LED) 
 is ON, and the reference position return ends and the coordinate system is 
automatically set.   
 
Note: Because setting the reference position without the block is to detect the 1st PC signal of the current position 
and it is taken as the reference position, so the set reference positions after power on may be different, the 
tool offset must be reset with the method.  
 
 
Setting the reference position of the absolute encoder  
When the machine tool is configurated with the absolute position encoder and the absolute 
position encoder reference position function is valid, the reference position return of the absolute 
position encoder should be executed when the system hasn’t set the reference position. After the tool is 
returned to the reference position, the reference position return finish lamp (LED) is ON, and the 
coordinate system is automatically set.   
Steps of reference position return:  


 GSK988MA/MB Series Milling Center CNC System Programming & Operation User Manual 
 
230
II Operation 
（1）Press the reference position return switch 
, and it is one of the mode selection switch;  
（2）Press one of the rapid movement override switches 
 for deceleration;   
（3）After pressing the feeding axis corresponding the reference position return and the direction 
selection switch 
, the reference position return is started. The tool is moved to the 
deceleration point at the rapid traverse rate (The absolute position encoder zero return doesn’t have the 
deceleration point and it can be directly returned to the reference position), and the tool is returned to the 
reference position at FL speed set by the parameter. After the tool is returned to the reference position, 
the reference position return finish lamp (LED) 
 is ON; 
（4）The same operation is executed for other axes.  
Note 1: The manual reference position return can only be returned to the 1st reference position, the coordinate 
system is automatically set after the manual reference position return ends.

Fig.5-1 
In MPG mode, the machine tool can be continuously moved by MPG on the machine tool operation 
panel. The moving axis is selected by the switches
 
. When MPG is rotated for 
one scale, the minimum distance moved by the tool equals to the least input increment. When MPG is 
rotated for one scale, the tool movement distance can be scaled up for 10 times or for two magnifications 
set by the parameters (#7113 and #7114). 
Steps of MPG feeding:

 key to enter MPG mode;  
（2）Press MPG feeding axis selection switch
 to select the axis to 
be moved by the machine tool;  
（3）Press MPG feedrate override switch 
 to select the override of the 
machine tool movement. When MPG is rotated for one scale, the minimum distance moved by the 
machine tool equals to the product of the least input increment timing the current override. The override 
selected by the override switches 
 can be rewritten by the parameters 7113 and 7114;    
（4）After MPG is rotated, the machine tool is moved along the selected axis and MPG is rotated for 
360 degrees, and the machine tool movement distance equals to that of the current pulse equivalent 
*100.  
The MPG feeding direction is set by MPG rotation direction. Normally, MPG CW rotation is positive 
feeding, CCW rotation is negative feeding.  
The above mentioned is one example, please refer to the user manual from the machine tool builder 
for operation. 
Note 1: In manual mode (JHD), the validity of MPG;  
Whether MPG is valid in Manual mode is set by the parameter JHD (bit 0 of #7100), MPG feeding and incremental 
feeding all are valid when parameter JHD (bit 0 of #7100) is set as 1.

Note 2: The manual pulse generator（MPG）commanded speed exceeds the rapid traverse rate (HPT):  
The specification of parameter HPT (the 4th bit of #7100):   
Setting as 0: When the feedrate is limited in the rapid traverse rate, the pulse exceeding the rapid traverse rate is 
invalid (The machine tool movement distance may be not consistent with the scale of MPG).  
Setting as 1: The feedrate is limited in the rapid traverse rate, and the pulse exceeding the rapid traverse rate is 
valid and accumulated in CNC.(Although the MPG is not rotated, the machine tool can’t stop immediately. After 
MPG stops, due to the effect of the pulse in CNC, the machine tool still moves.) The allowable value of the 
memory is set by the parameter #7117, then, the exceeding pulse is also ignored.  
Note 3: The axis movement direction and the rotary direction of MPG:  
When the tool is moved along the axis, MPG direction is switched by the parameter HNGx (0 bit of #7102) and it is 
corresponding to the rotation direction of MPG.  
Note 4: Quantity of MPG:  
Maximum two manual pulse generators can be connected, which is set by the parameter #7110. Two manual

If the machine tool is installed with the automatic tool setting device, CNC can send the command 
for automatic measuring, and then CNC can automatically measure or determine the tool compensation 
amount. Firstly, the command for measuring is sent and the tool is moved into the measured position. 
CNC automatically measures the difference between the coordinate value of the measuring point and that 
of the commanded (the expected) measuring position and the difference is taken as the compensation 
amount of the tool. When the tool has been compensated, the tool is moved into the measured position 
after compensated. The difference between the coordinate value of the measured point and that of the 
commanded coordinate value is accumulated into the current set compensation amount.
