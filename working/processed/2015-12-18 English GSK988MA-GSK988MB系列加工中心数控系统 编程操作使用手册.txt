1.3.6 Workpice Coordinate System
The workpiece coordinate system rectangular coordinate system based the part drawing,
also called floating coordinate system. The workpiece coordinate system set the system
advance, can changed moving its coordinate origin point. The established workpiece valid till
replaced new one. The system has preset workpice coordinate systems (G54-G59).
1.3.7 Local Coordinate System
When the system compiling programs the workpiece coordinate system, sub-coordinate

Interpolation defined planar three dimensional contour formed path multiple
axes moving the same time, also called Contour control. The controlled moving axis called link
axis when the interpolation executed. The moving distance, direction and speed are controlled
synchronously the course running form the required Composite motion path. Positioning
control defined that motion end point one axis multiple axes instead the motion path the
course running controlled.
Linear interpolation: Composite motion path Xp. and axis straight line from start
point end point.
Circular interpolation: Composite motion path Xp/Yp. Yp/Zp and Zp/Xp axis arc radius

1.4.1 Absolute Programming and Incremental Programming
There are two kinds modes for commanding axis offset, one absolute command the other
incremental command. The absolute command programmed coordinate value the terminal
position the axis movement. The incremental command directly programmed the movement
value the axis. They are separately specified G90 and G91 commands.
Code format: G90 IP__; Absolute command
G91 IP_; Incremental command
1.4.2 Decimal Programming
Value can input decimal programming. Distance, time and speed can input decimal
programming. The following addresses can use decimal point:
and and other addresses cannot use decimal programming. alarm occurs word has more
than one decimal point; alarm occurs when address which cannot specified decimal
point has decimal point.
There are two types decimal point usage which decided No. 3401 BitO(DPI).

GSK988MA provides the macro code which similar the high language, and can realize the
variable assignment, and subtract operation, logic decision and conditional jump user macro code,
contributed compiling part program for special workpiece, reduce the fussy counting and simplify
the user program.
2.24.1 Variable
(1) variable use
The variable can specify the address value the program. The variable value assigned
the program code set directly the keyboard. One program can use many variables
which can distinguished their variable number.
Variable expression
Use “#’+variable number express;
Format: (i=200, 202, 203,
一 Example: #205, #209, #225.
Besides, the expression can used specify the variable number. the moment, the
expression must the brackets.
Example: #[#20+#30/4]
Variable reference
Use variable permute the number following address.
ead Format: address +“# address +“—# means take the variable value
the negative value value the variable the address value.
Example: F#203...#203=15: the same those functions;
2-#210...4#210=250: the same those Z-250 functions;
G#230...#230=3: the same those functions.
When the variable value used program, the decimal point can omitted. Example:
#1=123: the actual value 123.000.
When the variable value followed the axis code address has the decimal point, the data
less than the least setting unit executes the rounding. For example: #1=1.23456; the axis
least setting unit 0.001, the tool execute GOO X#1 positions 1.235 position.
Use variable permute variable number.
Format: “#’+[variable number]
Example: uses #30 execute the permutation #5, written #[#30].
Refer the undefined variable.
When the variable not defined, becomes the “Null” variable. When the variable
Null, only read instead being written.
When the system refers the undefined variable, ignores the variable and the word.
Example: when the variable #10 value the variable #!1 value Null and the system
executes G00 X#10 Y#11, the execution result GOO XO, Y#11 ignored.
course operation, besides using null variable assignment, null variable value the
same that other cases.
When #2=<Null> #1=#2, #1=<Null>;
#1=#2*3,
#1=#2+#2, #1=0;
Beside using the Null assign, the variable value other conditions.

When #2=<Null>, #0, the condition false.
When #2=0, #0, the condition false.

(3) Variable range
The input range the local variable and common variable -99999999~99999999 which
integer part and decimal part are 8-digit number. When the assignment exceeds the valid
range, alarm occurs. When the operation result exceeds -99999999~99999999 and stored
into the variable, the system window displays “***” which means overflow. When the variable
used code, the relevant operation result displayed “***”; when the digit exceeds 8-digit, its
former digits are valid, and its ninth digit rounded; the middle result the macro variable
count can more than the valid input digital.
Note The variable cannot referred address and The system cannot use O#200, N#220 execute the
programming;
Note When the variable exceeds the max. code value defined the address, cannot used; for example: #230
120: M#230 exceeds the max. code value;
Note The system cannot identify and taken
Note When the variable used the address data, the other except for the valid digit rounded.
Note The number followed the address can use <Formular> replace. The system takes “Word address

The program execution interrupted and the system displays one message. i.e. the single stops
after the system executes the block, and the system displays only one prompt. The variable only
written instead being read.
When the system executes the assignment statement #3006=1, stops the
run and displays only one prompt message.
The alarm message only displays characters (13 Chinese characters),
and the system only displays the first characters when there are more than
it. The value the alarm number being #3006 adds 3200, the prompt number
range 3201 3500. When #3006 value less than the alarm number
For example:

point, but arc only. The position offset exists between actual cutting point and ideal point when the
cutting feed performed. may cause over cut undercut, the part accuracy will affected. So,
the cutter radius compensation can used improve the part accuracy machining.
The path part figure can shifted cutter radius, which this method called type tool
compensation; this simply method but the movement path next block can processed only after
block performed, the phenomenon over cutting will generated the intersection point
two blocks. 一
order settle the above issues and eliminate the error, the Tool compensation should
setup. When block read in, the tool compensation not performed immediately but the next block
read again. Corresponding movement path calculated according the point intersection two
blocks (conjunction vector). The tool compensation performs more accurate compensation figure
because two blocks are read for processing advance. See the Fig. 6-1.

4.2.5 Interference check
Tool over cutting called “interference”. The interference check function can check tool over cutting
advance. This interference check performed even the over cutting does not occur. However, all
interference can not checked this function.
(1) Conditions for the interference
The direction the tool path different from that the programmed path. (90 degrees 270
degrees between these paths)
addition the condition above, the angle between the start point and end point the tool
center path quite different from that between the start point and end point the programmed

(3) Automatic interference vector clear
The system has the automatic interference vector clear function. For example, when the neighbor
three blocks N10, N20, N30 execute the tool radius compensation, the section between N10 and
N20 creates the vector V1, V2, and V4, and the section between N20 and N30 creates V5, V6,
V7, V8. The system executes the interference check the last vectors the above two group
vector, i.e. and V5. and are ignored when there the interference; the system checks
and V6, and they are ignored when there the interference; the system does and V7, and they
are ignored when there the interference. When the system executes the interference check the
last vectors and V8, and there the interference, they cannot ignored, the tool stops
movement and the system alarms. Based the above process, the system executes the
interference check, and has checked the vector which not interfered, the followings are not check,
and the tool runs according the path the first group vector which does not create the
interference. When the last group vector creates the vector, they cannot ignored, the tool stops
movement and No.257 alarms.

4.2.6 Command compensation vector cancel temporarily
the following commands G92, G28, G29, coordinate command selection G54~G59 and canned
