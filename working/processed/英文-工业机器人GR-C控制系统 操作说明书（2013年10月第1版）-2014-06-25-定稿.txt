4.5.2.1 Teaching Programming
There are teaching programs, one new program, and the other the
modification the registered program.
The new program performs based upon the following steps:
Create program
Add modify program line
Teaching inspection program
The registered program modification performs based upon the following steps:
Open saved registered program
Modify add program line
Teaching inspection program
Refer the Section “4.8 Program Example’ for details.
4.5.2.2 Teaching Inspection
The teaching inspection should performed the teaching mode, which can
divided into single continuous, and shift [Single/Continuous]; can separated
into forward teaching and back teaching. The combination the teaching inspection:
single forward, consecutive forward, single backward and consecutive backward.
Note: During the teaching inspection operation, stops edit move the original position
manually, and then perform the forward/backward teaching; may not operate
according original path; refer the “Trace movement after editing’.

Regular expression search the search that the regular expression regarded
the search key word.
The regular expression has many complicated functions, here just use
fraction them; refer the following rules.
The regular expression composes letter, number and symbol.
Symbol with some specified meaning
The symbol means quantity:
point symbol: means any single character.
start symbol: means that the left character can appeared freely,
zero included.
For example: BA* can matched with BA, BAA, BAAA...
The symbol means position:
means that the upmost left character must appeared the
beginning the command.
means that the upmost left character must appeared the end
the command.
