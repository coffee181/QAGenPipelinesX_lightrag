directly programming with the axis movement amount, called relative coordinate programming (also
called incremental coordinate programming).
Absolute coordinates
The coordinates the target position the specified workpiece coordinate system, that is, the
coordinate position which the tool moved.

Modal means that the value address remains valid soon set until reset.
Another meaning modal that after function word set, the same function used later
program segment, not necessary input the field.
For example, the following programs:
X100 Y100; (Fast positioning X100 Y100)
X20 Y30; (Fast positioning X20 Y30, modal specified and not required
input)
X50 Y50 F300; (Linear interpolation X50 Y50, feed speed 300mm/min 一 G1)
X100; (Linear interpolation X100 Y50, feed speed 300mm/min, G1, Y50, F300
are modal specified and are not required input)
YO; (Fast positioning YO)
The initial state refers the default modal after the system powered on. See Table 4-1-2
for details.
For example, the following programs:
000001
X100 Y100; (Fast positioning X100 Y100, the initial state the system)
F100; (Linear interpolation YO, feed per minute speed 100mm/min)
Non-modal means that the value the corresponding address valid only the program
segment where this code written, and must reassigned used the later program segment.
For example, Group Code Table 4-1-2.
See Table 2-5-1 for the modal and non-modal descriptions the function words.

General considerations about offset:
(A) Designation offset number

can specified anywhere before the state shifts from the cancelled offset the tool
radius compensation.
(B) Shift from the cancelled offset state the tool radius compensation state
The movement code when entering into the tool radius compensation state from the
cancelled offset state must positioning (GOO) linear interpolation (G01)，and
circular interpolation (G02, G03) cannot used.
(C) Conversion left and right tool radius compensation
When the offset direction changes from left right, from right left, will usually
through the offset cancelled state. However, positioning (GOO) linear interpolation
(G01) can directly converted without going through the offset cancelled state. The

(E) Positive and negative offset and tool center path
When the offset set negative value, the workpiece machined equivalent the
case where G41 and G42 the program sheet are converted. Therefore, cutting
machining along the outer side workpiece becomes cutting machining along the
inner side workpiece.
general programming shown below, assume the offset positive value:
When the tool path programmed shown Figure (A), the offset set
negative value, the tool movement path shown Figure (B); similarly, when the

Graphs with sharp corners are commonly used (patterns with sharp circular
interpolation). However, when the offset set negative value, the inner circle the
part cannot machined. case cutting inner sharp corner, insert arc
appropriate radius there, and then perform cutting after smooth transition.
Selection left right compensation depends whether the compensation direction
the left right side the tool movement direction relative the workpiece (the
workpiece considered motionless). G41 G42 puts the system into compensation
mode while G40 causes the system cancel the compensation mode.
example compensation program follows:
Program Segment (1) called start part, and this segment, G41 changes the mode
from compensation cancelled compensation. the end point this segment, the
tool center compensated with the tool radius perpendicular the next program path
(from P2). The tool compensation quantity specified DO7, that is, the
compensation number set and G41 represents the tool path left compensation.
After the compensation starts, when the workpiece shape programmed

ro) Excessive cutting the tool called “interference”. Interference can used pre-check
excessive tool cutting. The system will give alarm interference detected the syntax
check after the program loaded in. set Position Parameter NO: 41#6 whether
interference check performed during radius compensation.
Basic conditions for interference:
(1) The movement distance the program segment for tool radius compensation smaller
than the tool radius.
(2) The tool path direction different from the program path direction. (The angle between the
paths between 90° and 270°).
(3) During arc machining, addition the above conditions, the angle between the start point
and the end point the tool center path greatly different from the angle between the start
point and the end point the program path (180° more).

12. General considerations about compensation
Specify the compensation quantity
The compensation quantity specified the code. Once specified, the code
remains valid until another code specified, the compensation cancelled. The
code not only used specify the tool radius compensation quantity, but also used
specify the tool offset value. 到
Change the compensation quantity
Normally when the tool replaced, the compensation quantity must changed the
compensation cancelled mode. changed the compensation mode, the new
compensation quantity will calculated the end point the program segment.

Positive negative compensation quantity and tool center path
the compensation quantity negative value G41 and G42 the program will
interchanged. the tool center moves along the outer side the workpiece, will move
along the inner side and vice versa, shown the following example.
general, the compensation quantity positive during programming. When the tool
path programmed shown Figure (a), the compensation quantity negative
the tool center will move shown Figure (b) and vice versa. Therefore, the same
program can cut into male female form, and the gap between them can
adjusted selection compensation quantity.

How use variables
Variables can used specify the parameter values user macro program itself. The value
variable can assigned the main program set LCD/MDI, assigned with the
result figured out when the user macro program itself executed.
Several variables can used, which are distinguished variable number.
(1) Representation variables
Use followed variable number represent the variable; the format follows:
#i(i=1,
(Example) #5, #109, #1005
(2) Reference variables
variable can replace the value after parameter value.
(Example) F#103 case #103=15, the same the F15 command.
G#130 case #130=3, the same G3.
Note: Reference variables not applicable the parameters and (program number and
sequence number). Programming with O#100, N#120 not allowed.
When exceeding the maximum code value specified the parameter, the variable
cannot used. case #30=120, M#30 exceeds the maximum code value.
Display and setting variable values: The value variable can displayed the
LCD screen, and can also set the MDI mode.
Classification variables
Variables can classified into empty variables, local variables, common variables, and [iy
system variables, which have different purposes and properties.
(1) Empty variables #0: (The variable always empty and value can assigned the
variable)
(2) Local variables #50: local variables can only used store data macro programs;
Position Parameter NO: 52#7 can used for reset setting determine whether delete 到
data after emergency stop. When macro program called, the local variables are
assigned independent variables.
(3) Common variables #100 #199, #500 #999: Position parameter NO: 52#6 can used for
reset settings determine whether eliminate the common variables #100 #199 after
emergency stop.
Common variables can shared the main program and all user macro programs called
the main program. That is, the variable used certain user macro program the same
used other macro programs. Therefore, the common variable result operation
certain macro program can used other macro programs.
there are rules about the purpose common variables the system, these variables can
freely used users.

Number calls
rogram number the called macro program itself
After G65, the program number user macro program specified the address the number
calls specified and the data passed the macro program via independent variables.
When repeating required, the number repetitions from 9999 specified after the address
and when omitted, the default number
The independent variable can used assign its value the corresponding local variable.
Note alarm generated when the subprogram number specified the address cannot retrieved (PS
078).
Note The subprograms No. 90000~99999 are the system retained programs. When the user calls such
subprograms, the system can execute the subprogram content, but the cursor will stay the G65 program 和
segment, and the program interface will always display the main program content. (The subprogram
contents can displayed modifying Position Parameter NO: 27#4.)
Note Macro programs cannot called DNC mode.

used command the feed speed the tool. The unit mm/min. The tool moves the cutting feed
rate programmed. Use the feed override key the operation panel the machine tool implement
the feed override cutting (the range the feed override adjustment is: 0%-200%).
order prevent mechanical vibration, acceleration can set data parameters P125-P128
when the tool movement starts and ends with automatic acceleration deceleration.
The maximum cutting speed set the data parameter P96, and the minimum cutting speed
set the data parameter P97. the cutting speed higher than the maximum limit, limited the
upper limit; lower than the minimum limit, limited the lower limit.
The cutting feed speed the automatic mode when the power switched set the data
parameter P87.
The cutting speed can specified two ways;
Feed per minute (G94): specify the tool feed per minute After

7.4 Feed Speed Override Key
The feed override under manual mode and automatic mode can adjusted through the override
adjustment key the operation panel, with the range 0-200% (10% for each gear, gears total).
Under automatic mode, when the override adjustment key set zero, the system will stop feeding,
showing the cutting override zero; then the override adjustment key should adjusted keep the
program running.
7.5 Automatic Acceleration and Deceleration
The system drives the motor automatically accelerate and decelerate the beginning and end
movement; can start and stop smoothly. also automatically accelerates and decelerates when
the movement speed changes; the speed change can proceed smoothly. Therefore, there
need consider acceleration and deceleration when programming.
Fast feed: Forward acceleration and deceleration (0: linear; S-type) Post acceleration and
deceleration (0: linear; exponential type).
Cutting feed: Forward acceleration and deceleration (0: linear; S-type) Post acceleration and
deceleration (0: linear; exponential type).
Manual feed: Post acceleration and deceleration (0: linear; exponential type).
