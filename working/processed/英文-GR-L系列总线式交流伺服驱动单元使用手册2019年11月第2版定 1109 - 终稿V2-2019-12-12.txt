Chapter Product Introduction
CHAPTER PRODUCT INTRODUCTION
The GR-L series bus servo drive unit (hereinafter referred the servo unit),
developed and manufactured GSK CNC Equipment Co., Ltd., supports the GSK-Link
bus protocol.
Basic features this series servo unit:
The control algorithms the permanent-magnet synchronous servo motor and
asynchronous spindle servo motor are integrated, the motor parameters can set adapt
the permanent-magnet synchronous servo motor and asynchronous spindle servo motor.
Due the high-speed real-time communication with the CNC through GSK-Link fieldbus, the
connection simplified, and the transmission distortion analog signals and pulse signals can
avoided. The servo unit also supports the real-time monitoring, parameter management and servo
parameter tuning through the CNC
Various control modes are supported: position, speed, position/speed and torque control modes.
Two position feedback input interfaces are provided, supporting encoder communication protocols
(e.g. BISS, Endat2.2 and Tamagawa) and incremental encoders. The absolute incremental
grating rulers can connected for full closed-loop control.
This product has strong overload drive capability and large brake pipe capacity. can
connected with the external brake resistor, with high starting and braking speeds.
Three voltage levels, i.e. 220V, 380V and 440V are available adapt different power grids.

2.3 Installation Interval
The GR-L series bus-type servo drive unit installed the base plate, perpendicular
the mounting surface. Make the front side face the front and top face up, order facilitate heat
dissipation. Provide the necessary spacing around the servo unit.
When multiple servo units are used, the intervals should maximized during installation,
provide good cooling conditions.
order prevent the temperature around the servo unit from rising continuously, the electrical
cabinet should internally subject heat dissipation through air convection.
The recommended installation interval the servo unit follows.
